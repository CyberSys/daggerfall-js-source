# AUDIT NAV2 - the sea's second pass, read end to end, 2026-09-30

Mac: *"Let's do a deep comprehensive audit on everything developed thus far"*, of the naval arc's second pass as PR
#467 carried it: SEA-PEACE, HELM-KEYS, DECK-FIELD, HELM-WAY, DECK-WALK and SHIPMATES, LIVING CREW (slice D), and the
three merges of main that carried them (`03-World/Naval-Combat.md`, `03-World/Come-Sail-Away.md`; Port-Ledger A).
Seven lenses read it against its own pages on the arc's own harnesses - the captains, the helm, the deck, friend and
foe, the living crew, online and the seams, the frame's cost - and the merges were checked hunk by hunk (every side's
normalized lines counted three ways: nothing lost).

Every finding below was re-run on its probe before it was fixed, and pinned by a test that fails on the code as the
second pass shipped it: `test/auditnav2_online.test.js` (8), `auditnav2_boarding` (7), `auditnav2_captains` (17, 19 as
the runner counts them), `auditnav2_helm` (9), `auditnav2_combat` (6), `auditnav2_deck` (12) and `auditnav2_crew` (26)
- 85 pins. Mutation-proven: `tools/mutants/auditnav2_*.json`, 213 records, all dead. Each fix carries an
`AUDIT NAV2 F<n>` comment. Six fixers worked in parallel on files of their own and were merged here; F43 and F62 were
found and fixed at those merges. The relay law holds: nothing in `server/src`, `src/net` or `src/world/mat4.js` moved,
and the naval word's two new keys are ones an older build's door passes and reads nothing of.

## Fixed

### Online and the seams

| ID | Sev | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | High | **A captain's temper was her stander's alone.** Warm Ashes' raiders and a hand-launched pirate are made BOLD by the host, but a peer's copy and an heir re-read her seed's temper - WARY. The peer got no "Sail ho!", could rest and travel while she closed to board them, and an heir's copy sailed off. | The naval word's `k` key: each ship's captain - her temper, her mode, the ship she struck to (`navalWire.js`); a reader takes them (`navalHost.js applyWord`). |
| F2 | Low | **A peer's boat was sized at a full crew.** The stander sized another player's crewless boat as crewed while the peer sized herself single-handed (3,300 against 2,357 under the old product), so a wary pirate took on one screen what she left on the other. | The word's `m` key: the owner's boat - her crew, her battle, her hull. `peerPowerOf` sizes her as `myPowerOf` does, on F25's measure. |
| F3 | Medium | **A peer's copy of a ship in a fight had her crew at peace.** The word carried no mode, and a peer's own boat in a fight was always at peace too. | Her captain's mode in `k`; the boat's battle in `m`; `naval.peerBoat` hands both to the crews' frame. |
| F4 | Medium | **A rider on another player's boat was ashore.** SEA-PEACE's aboard counted only a boat of one's own or a sea ship's deck, so a pirate closing on the boat was no threat to her rider: rest, travel and the time scale stayed open under fire. | The contact half: `meContact` sizes the rider as the boat she rides (`deps.aboardPeer`); the aboard half with F36. |
| F5 | Low | **A prize lost her victor at a handover.** Only the stander knew whom she struck to, so an heir's navy sailed off and the prize lay struck for good. | Her victor in `k`; `releaseOwner` links an adopted prize to her adopted victor. |
| F7 | Low | **A boarding that left with its boarder left her unboardable.** Adoption never cleared the word's `boarded`: her crew was held for good. | `adopt` clears `boarded`. |
| F10 | Low | **The watch's stop could fire mid-sea-fight.** REP1's box (no Escape) opened at a helm under a pirate's guns. | Mac: "Not in a sea fight" - the stop waits while a hostile ship is near a player aboard or a boarding is on (`world.js`, `06-Systems/Standing-Arc.md`). |
| F12 | Medium | **A boarding's bodies were one client's, and the page said otherwise.** They stood PLACED, and a placed foe never rides the foes frame, so the room never saw the fight on her deck, and the crew's `cw` (DECK-WALK's "Online") named no body on a deck. | Mac: "Share it now" - they stand `loose` on the frame: her men as foes, my hands as the reader's shipmates; no foe handover names an heir for a body on a deck. |
| F13 | Low | **A won prize's men came back over open water.** A save after "Leave her" carried the yielded men at deck height, and a load stood them in the air. | `transient` - no save carries a boarding's body. |

### Boarding

| ID | Sev | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| F19 | Low | **Boarders thrown back struck her by the wrong line.** HELM-WAY's unmanned strike took her on the crew line at 95% and burning, and the hull line (NAV-R's share, her fires out) never ran. | `winBoarding`: her hull first, then her crew gone over the rail. |
| F32 | Medium | **Bodies stood on each other, and on the player.** On a short deck the rail answered one cell again and again and the dealer went round, so hands stood on her men and on the player (AUDIT NAV1 B10 undone). | Every body a spot of its own, BODY_GAP clear of every other and of the landing and the player's feet; a deck stands no more than it holds. The deck half: F32 below. |
| F37 | Low | **A raid's waves were not over the rail first.** One shuffle of the rail's spots and the deck's put two of the first eight at the rail. | The rail's dealt before the deck's, each shuffled in its own (`placeQuestFoe`). |
| F43 | Medium | **Warm Ashes' raid on a crewed deck left the crew wandering among the raiders.** The fight took the Galley's four hands off her deck and fielded none, and her other four walked, talked and sang among the raiders. | The raid's own `_ally_` are the crew (NAV1 B2's law), so the world's crews' frame holds the living crew off that deck till it ends (`hold`). Found as a request to stand hands in a raid; re-scoped at the merge. |
| F44 | Medium | **Her men stood as someone else.** A man thrown back and boarded again stood as the muster's next class - an Archer as a Rogue. | Each man of hers his own class where he stood. |
| F49 | Low | **A fallen hand came back.** The fight's losses touched no crew, and the crew stood whole again. | A hand who falls is his CREW_PER_HAND off the boat's crew when the fight ends. |

### The captains

| ID | Sev | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| F8 | Low | **The guns a navy hears were left behind by the world.** The reports were neither moved by a floating-origin shift nor emptied by a transition: a navy steered for a phantom. | `offsetAll` moves them; `clear()` empties them. |
| F21 | Medium | **The stern chase caught only a runner dead on the line and faster than half the pursuer's pace.** A cutter first fired on a runner at 0.45 of her pace at 91.8 s; 8 degrees off the line, one chaser volley in 90 s; a chase that lost ground and closed again was given up at 151 s. | A quarry in flight run down at any pace; the bend closes by CHASE_MARGIN of her pace; the chasers steer for their own lead (`chaserLead`); the lead laid abeam only when it will be in reach, and held; the gain measured against the farthest mark of the last CHASE_GIVE_UP_S. |
| F22 | Medium | **No way round land.** A prize behind a spit was circled for ever, and a boat lying still 30 m behind one was never boarded in 600 s while the brig held her broadsides - a refuge a player could use. | The berth sounded (one on land swapped for the open side); a way round by one sounded waypoint (`routeTo`); a boarding that gains nothing in CHASE_GIVE_UP_S given up, the prize spared. 24 of 24 approaches round the spit grapple. |
| F23 | Medium | **Two ships struck to each other lay so for ever.** The struck kept her target, and the engaged rule never asked the taker's state. | A ship that strikes or sinks fights no one; a mode counts as engaged only afloat. |
| F24 | Medium | **Galleys fought low hulls from inside their own guns' dead zone.** A war galley on a wary sloop lay 1439 s of 2400 inside it; a corsair galley fired no volley at a Large Boat in 300 s. | `layMin`: a battery's dead zone per target hull (a galley's great guns 91 m on a Large Boat, her broadside 57); her stem turned only where the great guns strike, her range never inside, the range opened inside the broadside's. |
| F25 | Medium | **FIGHTING POWER picked the wrong winner of half the navy-pirate duels.** It counted the hull a salvo takes and never the men, while every hurt kills men and, since HELM-WAY, a ship with no hands strikes. | Mac: "Model crew losses" - the measure, and the odds: the time each ship needs to make the other strike, by hull or by men, each ball at the other's size (`strikeTime`, `odds`, `hitShare`). The duels bear it out (below). |
| F26 | Low | **A galley's ram sank a prize outright.** | One captain's ram on another's sound ship stops at the strike. |
| F27 | Low | **A fleeing quarry was let go mid-chase while her pursuer was kept.** | Any ship an engaged ship targets is in the fight. |
| F28 | Low | **The captains' way was not the player's for heavy hulls.** The Carrack gained way at half the player's rate; the galley lost it at twice. | `HULL_BUILDS.sailWay` scales the captains' rates as the player's hull's. |
| F29 | Low | **Over the side or ashore, the boat mended through her fight.** The mending's quiet asked the player's hostile, not the boat's. | The lens's answer, adopted: the quiet measured from the boat (`hostileNearBoat`). |
| F30 | Low | **A merchantman took prizes.** | Mac: "No, they sail on" - only navies and pirates take a prize. |

### The helm

| ID | Sev | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| F14 | Medium | **Flipping Ship handling mid-voyage froze a Carrack for good.** The hold was re-weighed only at the helm's start and each magic round, so the next round set it to nought: 10.81 m/s and 7.14 deg/s for ever. | The handling taken once a helm, at StartSailing, till she is let go; the Features row says so. |
| F15 | Medium | **The in-irons tell never fired with the mod's default waves.** It read her velocity with the sea's current in it. | Her way through the water (`MoveVectorCurrent`). |
| F16 | Medium | **The Overworld's sea crossing refused the Carrack**, which the responsive helm sails. | Accepted under the responsive handling. |
| F17 | Low | **A journey's helm said "Sails up/down" and took the arrows' sail.** | Under the travel view the panel is covered and the sail keys stand down. |
| F18 | Low | **The in-irons advice assumed the classic rudder.** Under the responsive helm the helm alone brings her 40 degrees off the wind in about 10 s. | Its own advice under the responsive helm. |
| F20 | Low | **helmWay.js's figures did not reproduce like for like.** | Re-measured at 1/60 s, the speeds named (`03-World/Come-Sail-Away.md`). |
| F31 | Medium | **The readout said "E: hold fire" and E grappled.** Interact went to the activation ladder, whose naval arm grappled a struck ship in reach with the guns laid; the release then fired a six-ball broadside into her. | `useEdge` first in the frame's gate; the ladder's board refuses while the guns are laid. |

### Friend and foe

| ID | Sev | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| F54 | High | **A failed pickpocket on one of the player's own hands turned him - and he stayed a shipmate.** The steal's failure ran only the motor half of DFU's MakeEnemyHostileToAttacker: he beat the player (4 strikes for 22 hp) while every blow of the player's passed through him (20 swings, none landed). | A shipmate is no mark: the steal refuses him, and a town's defender; any other ally a failure makes fair game (the ally revert runs). |
| F55 | Medium | **A worn drain turned the crew.** Vampiric Effect at range drained every foe within 2.25 m through the foe sink as a player's attack: a shipmate beside the player was drained and turned, and a prize's yielded men un-surrendered. | The drain passes the spared and hurts as DFU's writes health, no attack; `damageFoe` refuses a player's blow on a shipmate. |
| F56 | Low | **A crewman's area spell struck the player and his mates.** Its caster named no foe, so the blast knew no crew. | The caster wrapper names its foe. |

### The deck

| ID | Sev | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| F4 | Medium | The aboard half of F4: another player's boat under the player's feet was not aboard. | `aboardShip` asks the ridden boat (`deps.aboardPeer`). |
| F11 | Medium | **The dead neither rode her nor went down with her.** The leash dropped the dead from the deck's bodies, so the carry never moved them: after a fight she sailed off from under her dead, who hung over open water. | The carry moves the dead; they are taken off when her hull leaves the pool. |
| F32 | Medium | **Small hulls had no deck to fight on.** The inset against the Large Boat's thwarts ate 18 of her waist's 30 cells: 12 cells, and the Rowboat 4. The Pirate Sloop and the Coasting Trader are Large Boats. | No inset against a bench (DECK_BENCH), none that would cost half her deck: the Large Boat 18 cells, the Rowboat 13; the rail's points distinct. |
| F33 | Medium | **Deck points stood on top of her structure.** The ray fell from 3 m, over the 1.7 m headroom the bake guarantees: 26 of the Carrack's 515 cells set points 2.1-2.7 m up on her bow structure. | The ray from under the headroom. |
| F34 | Medium | **Raised decks were out of every boarder's reach.** One level a cell cut the Small Ship's forecastle stair at 8.55, and the leash dragged a body on her forecastle 2.5 m down: a player there could not be reached. | Every floor at her main deck or over it, joined at the motors' step; her other pieces (poop, cabins, under the forecastle) baked beside the open deck, each body kept on its piece. |
| F36 | Low | **A quay near a moored hull's end was aboard.** The hull's box grown a metre read 332 m2 round a Small Ship as aboard, one point 19.6 m from her hull: the hunt, a bounty's trail and a band's chase stood down on a quay. | Aboard is a floor of hers within DECK_REACH_M (`deck.under`). |
| F38 | Low | **A quay over a shallow-water tile splashed.** | Shallow tiles are water under a model too. |
| F39 | Low | **The deck bake skipped classic-model colliders** (the Large Galley's helm model baked as open deck). | Their colliders baked as the world's. |
| F57 | High | **A Large Boat's rig was baked mid-voyage.** The deck was keyed by rig as well as hull, and only rig 0 was baked at the load: the first sight of a rig-3 Coasting Trader cost a 7-15 ms frame. | One deck a hull, baked at the load; the rigs' colliders proven equal. |
| F58 | Medium | **Every stand and boarding paid for its spots again.** The Large Galley's `spots(24)` cost 1.3 ms and 3.7 MB; a deck's main level was sorted and a hull's flats walked at every crew's first sight. | Spots made once a count; the main level once a deck; the flats once a rig. |
| F60 | Low | **Aboard built a hull box for every ship, every call** - 3.34 us and 11 KB against main's 0.14 us. | A ship far off is never asked. |
| F61 | Low | **The walk's heuristic used `Math.hypot`, and its comment called the corner cut linear.** | `Math.sqrt` (1.6x); the comment says quadratic. |

### The living crew

| ID | Sev | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| F6 | Medium | **A re-keyed ship stood two crews, then none.** A room's hand-over keeps her hull under a new key: the new crew read flats the old one had down, the old one's stand-down switched them back on beside the crew, and they stayed down once she left. A hold let go never stood her again. | Her crew moves to her new key; the rest stand down before any stands; a hold let go stands her whole. |
| F9 | Medium | **Owner and room saw two crews for one boat.** The owner seeded by the deed's uid and counted her hurt crew in battle; the room seeded by the key and counted a whole crew at peace. | Seeded `${whose}:${which}` on both sides (the owner's place among his word's boats); a reader counts her crew and her battle off her owner's word. |
| F35 | Low | **A station taken into a fight popped 7 m.** Her captain at the Small Ship's wheel was answered at his post on the poop, and the leash snapped him onto her main deck. | A man taken is answered with his feet on her deck. |
| F40 | Medium | **Nobody reached the rail.** The grapple's 2.2 s was the whole muster: at a repel's start 0 of 2 of my walkers were ready, at my boarding 1 of her 4; the rail was dealt by roster index (190.9 m of walks a muster on the galley). | The muster is called at boarding range (a ship closing to board, a struck ship in reach, within CREW_MUSTER_M), to the side the other will lie, dealt fore to aft by where the men stand; the stations keep their posts. |
| F41 | Medium | **Two men stood in one sprite for up to 110.8 s.** A spot was free of where men stood, not where they walked to; a talk begun on one point talked in place. | No spot within reach of anyone's walk's end; a stand-off to talk; a walker lets one earlier in the roster by. |
| F42 | Medium | **A crew never grew back, and never emptied.** `sync` only trimmed, and `trim` never took her first man. | A mending restores her count (never the men a fight took); every hand down stands nobody. |
| F45 | Low | **A ship going down swapped her living crew for the mod's flats.** | She keeps them to the end. |
| F46 | Low | **The crew's mood ignored the fight.** 5 to 13 talk lines under the guns a run, and 2856 frames of chanty and "Gold, lads" after she struck. | The guns end every talk; a struck or sinking crew is quiet. |
| F47 | Low | **The chanty's edges.** The next song began 0.03 s after its leader was taken; a verse was said over his own talk. | A dropped song waits CHANTY_S; the leader takes no talk while he sings. |
| F48 | Low | **The walks' edges.** A walk to a talk or to the muster waited on the player 23-29 s; a first leg crossed a hole. | Every walk gives up after CREW_BLOCKED_S; a walk starts along the deck's own line. |
| F50 | Low | **A concealed owner's crew wore their own faces.** | His look on his crew's batches. |
| F51 | Low | **"A Bard among them to lead the song" held for half the player's Small Ships.** | Second in line: among any crew of two or more. |
| F52 | Low | **With the arc off, the living crew still replaced the mod's flats.** | Gated on the arc. |
| F53 | Low | **Under a window the ships stood still and their crews walked and sang on.** | The crews' clock held with the sea's. |
| F59 | Low | **About 550 bytes of garbage a crewman a frame.** | A sprite's size written through; the texture key the uploader's, memoised; one motion object a host. |
| F62 | Low | **At the merge: the muster reached the raised decks F34 made.** Dealt along the whole deck, it stood the Small Ship's foremost man on her forecastle's top row, 0.68 m to port in a starboard muster; her port rail at her stern answered 2.82 m to starboard. | `deck.rail` never answers past her centreline, and at a level when asked; the muster lines her main deck's rail (`mainLevel`, beside the deck now). |

## F25 - the duels, before and after

Eight duels a matchup, the navy's wins and the pirate's (the harness's eight geometries):

| matchup | the old product's favourite | before | the odds (navy) | after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cutter v sloop | cutter | 2/6 (wrong) | 0.95 | 4/4 |
| cutter v brig | cutter | 6/2 | 1.11 | 8/0 |
| cutter v corsair galley | corsair | 8/0 (wrong) | 1.47 | 8/0 |
| cutter v flagship | flagship | 0/8 | 0.70 | 0/8 |
| war galley v sloop | galley | 1/7 (wrong) | 0 (the sloop's: no end) | 1/7 |
| war galley v brig | galley | 5/3 | 0.89 | 5/3 |
| war galley v corsair galley | galley | 7/1 | 1.18 | 5/3 |
| war galley v flagship | galley | 0/8 (wrong) | 0.56 | 0/8 |

Wherever the odds lean WARY_ODDS or better, the favourite wins six of eight; no side wins six of eight that the odds
do not lean to; every duel is fought to a strike. The before column was measured at 60 frames a second, the after at
the pin's 0.1 s.

## Mac's calls

1. **Duel balance: "Model crew losses"** - F25, above.
2. **The watch at sea: "Not in a sea fight"** - F10.
3. **Online boarding: "Share it now"** - F12.
4. **Merchants: "No, they sail on"** - F30.

## Checked and sound

- **The merges.** Each of the second pass's merges of main, and each fixer's merge here, was counted three ways on
  normalized lines: no hunk of either side lost.
- **The relay.** No change to the relay, the net layer or `mat4.js`; the word's new keys `k` and `m` are passed and
  unread by an older build's door (it counts `s` and `p` by their fields), and a newer door reads a longer entry's
  first fields.
- **The classic helm is the mod.** Classic handling reproduces Come Sail Away's IL; the helm is frame-rate independent;
  the arrow keys' shares and conflicts, the heave-to and the handling online are as their pages say.
- **The steady frame.** The crews' frame costs 0.18-0.19 ms at the median (0.32-0.39 at the 95th), the host's 1.95-2.0
  ms - main's.

## Not fixed

- **The helm**: the Ship handling taken at the helm is not in the save (a load takes the row's again); the pad's d-pad
  under the travel view; a journey with the view down; `test/helmway.test.js`'s comment.
- **The crew**: `MobileUnit.update` still answers a new object each call (PERF-TOWN1's per-unit row would end it; its
  settings read is shared with the town's loop, kept live on purpose); `comeSailAwayPeers.js` stamps `peerKey` at
  build and `realign` can move a boat to another slot without restamping, so after an owner's boat list reorders a
  reader's seed can drift from the owner's; a Large Galley boarded at the helm after about 4 s in reach has 3 of 8
  walkers ready (her rail places spread over 68 m).
- **Friend and foe**: a crewman's missile flies past the player but meets no pirate - an enemy's missile meets the
  player alone. No crewman casts today.
- **The deck**: `navalHost.js`'s header does not name the `aboardPeer` door; a walker could pass his own height to
  `deck.heightAt`.
- **The captains**: Mac's bar read literally - the favourite six of eight in every matchup - cannot hold where the
  matchup is even (0.95, 0.89 and 1.18 are 4/4, 5/3 and 5/3). A war galley still loses to a sloop 1/7 - the sloop
  fights at 55 m, inside the galley's dead zones: class balance, not captaincy. A war galley cannot lie at a berth
  beside a spit, so she gives the boarding up and spares the prize. Under the odds no wary pirate takes a player's
  Large Boat (a sloop's odds 0.21, a brig's 0.55: the swivels' two men a ball); the bold still come.
- **Four older survivors**: `navaudit_captains.json`'s NAV1-the-tacks-carry-dropped, NAV1-no-pay-off and
  NAV1-never-warped, and `navaudit_guns.json`'s NAV1G-no-bear-free, survive on the second pass as it shipped too -
  AUDIT NAV1's, not this audit's.

## PIN MOVED

`nav_g_online` (the word's two new fields), `auditrep` F3 (the sea's arms after the foot fight's), `deepshare` (the
deck's arm), `livingcrew` (each man his own class; a captain taken at the deck point nearest his post; a sinking ship
listed struck; the frame's clock under a pause), `disc19` (the same call), `csa_sailing` (in irons with the waves on),
`deckfield` and `prof1_client` (the frame's gate), `ows2_crossing` (the Carrack crosses), `csa_together` (the panel's
cover), `renown1` (`damageFoe`'s guard), `deckwalk` (THE REAL HULLS' spot tolerance), `seapeace` (the measure and the
odds) and `navaudit_captains` (M12 past CHASE_GIVE_UP_S) - each marked in its own line with its law intact. At the
merges: `auditnav2_online`'s F2 compares the measures whole and its F4 stands on the odds' one wary prize among the
player's hulls; `auditnav2_crew`'s repel asks every walker of mine ready, and its first-leg walk runs twelve seeds.
Other lists' records re-aimed by content at the new text, all dead.
