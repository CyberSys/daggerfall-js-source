# The Sea Update - what landed, and what is left (2026-09-25)

Mac, opening it: *"This is one of our largest updates yet to DFE. All
mods attached are to be compatible and implemented 1:1. No bugs, no
issues, no band aids. Alongside all of these changes will be an overhaul
and improvement, fixing any and all issues (especially with ingame
puddles and tiles in towns that are one square). ... Enabled on by
default and carefully choosing whats required for our online mode."*

Six mods and the water overhaul. Mac, closing the first branch
(`claude/dfe-major-update-overhaul-6k1ajv`): *"Let's hold off on sail
away. Just finish up and log future work."* This page is that log: what
the branch carries, and what the next session picks up, in the order the
work depends on itself. Each slice's own page is the record; this is the
way in.

## Landed

| slice | what | commit | page |
|---|---|---|---|
| WD1 + AS1 | the world-data patch layer (the author's edit over the player's own blocks); Aquatic Sprites 1.0 (Cliffworms) | `992f5b2b` | `02-Formats/World-Data-Patches.md`, `03-World/Aquatic-Sprites.md` |
| DS1 | Detailed Ships 1.0.0 (Cliffworms), its DET pieces the port's own stand-ins (Mac: "Build your own") | `70396ed2` | `03-World/Detailed-Ships.md` |
| WA1 | Warm Ashes - Ships 1.1 (Kamer), and the seams it needed (`systems/modSaveData.js`, the ship transport) | `ca7abcdb` | `03-World/Warm-Ashes-Ships.md` |
| DW-A to DW-D | Iliac Puddle No More 1.2.2 (jet082): the carved sea, its look, its swimmer | `1bcbec78` | `03-World/Deep-Waters.md` |
| DW-E1, DW-E2 | the runtime's other half; the seafloor's decorations | `186196de` | `03-World/Deep-Waters.md` |
| DW-E3 | the passive fish (items 9001-9007) | `f2f733b8` | `03-World/Deep-Waters.md` |
| DW-E4 | the deep's foes and the treasure guards | `25f05238` | `03-World/Deep-Waters.md` |
| WATER-PUDDLE | the puddles and the one-square town water: the shallow-water records drawn where their own art is water | this branch's last commit | `07-Rendering/Water-Arc.md` |
| DW-E5 | the sunken loot: the pulse, the stray piles and their rubble, the wrecks and their guards | `claude/funny-tesla-bhzv35` | `03-World/Deep-Waters.md` |
| DW-F | the close: the sea at a distance (Mac: "large square panels" - the far ground's skirt out of the carved sea, the world's fog on the top, WATER1 off the clipped tiles) and the audit pass over the whole mod, four readers against the assembly (the foes' column share, the breath behind a window, the save-load reset, the dungeon splash, the load flag, the guards' terrain, the loot's camera and velocity, the texture cache, the arrow's draw) | `claude/funny-tesla-bhzv35` | `03-World/Deep-Waters.md` |
| OH-A to OH-C | There's a Hole in the Bottom of the Ocean 1.1.0 (jet082): registered, the pits placed and cut into Iliac Puddle No More's floors through its own API, drawn (the core, the underside, the black, the miasma), the entrance a swimmer touches | `claude/funny-tesla-bhzv35` | `03-World/Ocean-Holes.md` |
| OH-D / OH-E | ...and the abyss: the template borrowed, cloned, flooded and renamed, the way down and back up to the pit, the Recall binding and the save; the flame foes gone, the deep's replacements and the aquatic quota, the lights and the quest resources gone, the loot upgraded, the fog and light darkened. On the way: a dungeon save carries the registered mods' records (WA1's seam, never handed to the dungeon's build), a dungeon build takes its own location, and a pile raises LootTables.OnLootSpawned for every key | `claude/funny-tesla-bhzv35` | `03-World/Ocean-Holes.md` |
| OH-F | ...and the close: the audit's eleven fixes (the settings live in every mode, the plume's box, the indoor queue, the abyss save's destroyed foes and species, the rebuild on load, the build's loot scoped, the descent held, the online door, the quest and allied spawns marked at the build, the hierarchy's order, the Wabbajack's LoadID, CurrentVariant), eight departures declared, the patch notes | `claude/funny-tesla-bhzv35` | `03-World/Ocean-Holes.md` |
| CSA-A (registration) | Come Sail Away 2.1 (RedRoryOTheGlen): the vendored manifest, settings, item templates and assembly; the fifty keys (three the assembly never names, proved off its string heap); Features, credits, the registry, the online lane (the player's own); the bundle's pictures measured - its travel map is Daggerfall's own `TRAV0I00.IMG`, never carried | `claude/funny-tesla-bhzv35` | `03-World/Come-Sail-Away.md` |

Every landed mod is on by default, registered (settings, Features,
credits, `01-Overview/Mod-Registry.md`) and placed in the online lane
(`systems/onlineLane.js`).

## Left

### 1 and 2. Iliac Puddle No More - DW-E5 and DW-F: LANDED (above)

The sunken loot is in and the mod is closed. What its close leaves for
Mac, on the Port-Ledger row (DECLARED, awaiting Mac's read): DW-E5, and
DW-F's departures (8) the world's fog on the top, (9) the whole stream
carved - the mod carves only what the player has come within a pixel of,
and a carved three by three in a vanilla sea is the square seam that was
reported, so the port keeps its whole-stream carve - (10) the unload
taking the mod's children, (11) surfacing giving the sky its fog colour
back (the mod leaves DFU's underwater colour as the fog above the sea
until the sky's texture next changes), (12) the swim's odometer riding the
recentre; and (3) now reaching DFU's billboards (the deep's foes, their
corpses, a pile dropped in the sea). Seen, not the mod's: past the
streamed grid the far ring (EV8) holds its haze at 85% through the middle
distance, so its sea reads a shade darker than the fully fogged edge of
the streamed world - EV8's own, over land and sea alike.

### 3. There's a Hole in the Bottom of the Ocean 1.1.0 (jet082) - OH-A to OH-F LANDED

Mac handed the archive over again on 2026-09-26, with Come Sail Away's.
The pits are in: registered and on by default (OH-A), placed and cut into
Iliac Puddle No More's floors through that mod's own API (OH-B), and drawn
- the blue-black hole on the sea, its underside, the black at the
opening, the miasma - with the entrance a swimmer touches (OH-C).
`03-World/Ocean-Holes.md` is the record; its three departures are on the
Port-Ledger row, DECLARED and awaiting Mac's read. Online, `Enabled`,
`PitSpawnRate` and `SeafloorHoleSize` are the room's, so every player in
a room cuts the same holes.

The abyss is in (OH-D, OH-E), and seen at Sentinel's pit: the swimmer
taken down into "The Deadwater Chasm of the Last Tide" (a region-5
template, 12 blocks, flooded, its 189 lights gone, 120 enemies with the
aquatic third met), back up onto the pit's entrance in 5 s, a Recall
anchor set inside bringing the abyss back, and a save made inside it
loading back into it. Its eleven departures (with OH-C's three) are on the
Port-Ledger row; one bug is kept on purpose (every weapon is upgraded, the
arrow too - `Ocean-Holes.md`). Three seams were fixed on the way: a
dungeon save now carries every registered mod's record, a dungeon build
takes its own copy of its location, and a treasure pile raises
LootTables.OnLootSpawned whatever its key (RRI's wear with it).

OH-F closed it: three audit lanes against the assembly found eleven real
faults, all fixed (`Ocean-Holes.md`, "The audit"), and eight more
departures are declared beside the first eleven. The online question has
its answer: the abyss and its template share the dungeon's own key but
not the relay room (`dungeon:m<mapId>`, the RENAMED map id), so their
memories stay apart - the one frame a Recall joined the dry template's
room is closed (the abyss's Update runs before the online frame), the
hour's respawn refuses a destroyed flame foe, and the destroy rides the
save, not the room (a field at the relay's door would be a relay
deploy). A load the abyss stands in is a rebuild, since the shared key
would otherwise patch the drowned dungeon in place. The patch notes have
their section.

### 4. Come Sail Away 2.1 (RedRoryOTheGlen) - IN PROGRESS (from 2026-09-27)

Held by Mac on 2026-09-25; the archive came again on 2026-09-26 with
Ocean Holes', the port read the hold as lifted and said so, and Mac
answered "continue". CSA-A has registered it (`03-World/Come-Sail-Away.md`,
the slices CSA-A to CSA-J and their state); what follows is the log as it
stood when the mod was held. The largest of the six: 12 C# files, about
7,500 lines decompiled (`ComeSailAway.cs` 6,808 of them), and a 13.5 MB
asset bundle of 10,465 objects - the boats' meshes, prefabs, animation
clips and animator, 59 textures, 8 FSB5 audio clips. A first draft of
the Unity asset decoders (mesh, animation, animator, prefab, bundle, and
FSB5 to Ogg) was written in a scratch worktree during this branch and
NOT kept - the container was ephemeral - so it is redone from the mod's
archive. What is already waiting for it in the port: Deep Waters' swim
check knows its boat (`world/deepWaterSwim.js` `isBoatEffectBundle`,
the effect bundle "ImOnABoat" / "I'm On A Boat" suppresses the swim),
and item template indices 1320/1321 are free. Online: a boat syncs most
cheaply as sidecar keys on the foes frame (`scenes/world.js`'s foes
stream), which needs no relay change; new pose fields would need a relay
redeploy.

### 5. The ARENA2-gated failures: CLEARED (2026-09-26)

The sixteen that failed with the game data present (and skipped on CI)
were all rigs; no source had regressed. Each was root-caused to the
commit that left it behind and re-pinned on the law that commit made,
and every re-pin was mutation-checked:
- The UI stubs had no scissor (CG1): audit18_ui_native F8/F9 and F10b,
  classquestions F2. F8/F9 also read a shadow under its only topic
  row, which its click selects, and ROAD-D D10's selected row has none.
- The data pins behind deliberate changes: terrain's nature y at
  TERRAIN-SCALE1's 1.25, world's MAGEAA00 flat with AUDIT 64 F12's
  `editor` stamp.
- A literal 'BOOKS' on a case-sensitive disk (DFU's folder is `books`,
  BookFile.cs:27): roada2 A2. The same literal broke the dev server's
  book fallback on Linux (fixed, pinned in audit68_repo) and silently
  skipped books' corpus sweep.
- The watch (audit18_hosts_dungeon, cityguards G3): the loot
  rebalance's quarter, RF2's one loot seam, and MAC-E's loot window.
- The court and the talk (audit18_systems_social F2, F4, F6 and
  AUDIT 21 F8): D10's answer-side question counter, B5's courtroom
  backdrop, E4's gold counter, and A3's served sentence.
- Four rigs that never ran against a real API: roadc_automap_pick,
  roadc_automap_window, roadb_castle, road_a5_seducer.

With `ARENA2_PATH` set, the whole suite passes.
