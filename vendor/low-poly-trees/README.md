# Low Poly Trees 5 - SquidKamer (its geometry vendored; its atlases rebuilt from the player's own data)

**LowpolyTrees** version 5, by **SquidKamer** (Kamer; the manifest's ContactInfo is "DFU Discord", its
DFUnity_Version 0.14.4, GUID `71cd95b4-ffe5-4338-816e-2b7def737d4b`). The mod's own description: "Adds low poly trees
to the wilderness."

The owner handed the shipped archive (`LowPolyTrees_V5-380-v5-1669847452.rar`, sha256 `035672fa...e7b6f62`, one file:
`Mods/lowpolytrees.dfmod`, 10,352,684 bytes, sha256 `07df852a...f83f74b56`) over on 2026-10-05: "Next mod to integrate
is this. Its important we make this compatible with seasons of daggerfall, ensure performance doesnt take a hit and draw
distance can remain the same. A true visual overhaul with no performance loss."

**Permission: [Mac: record SquidKamer's permission, or the link to it, here - the earlier mod records carry theirs in
this line.]** The archive carries no readme and the manifest no licence.

## What the mod is

253 prefabs, `ARCHIVE_RECORD` each - every nature archive, 500 to 511, the winter sets among them - that Daggerfall
Unity's MeshReplacement stands in place of a nature flat: on the terrains within one map pixel of the player's
(`TerrainNature.LayoutNature` -> `ImportNatureGameObject`, a terrain tree with a random scale of 0.6 to 1.4 and a
random turn - and a tint between white and grey that none of the mod's shaders reads) and in every location
(`ImportCustomFlatGameobject`, turned by `Random.InitState((int)position.x)`). No script, no settings: 116 meshes (16 to 4,488 triangles - most of them a
handful of crossed cards, some true low-poly shells), 32 materials, 30 textures, and the manifest.

## What is here, and what deliberately is NOT

- `lowpolytrees.dfmod.json` - the manifest, byte for byte.
- `Trees/trees.json`, `Trees/trees.bin` - the author's geometry (every mesh's positions, normals and uv0, and its
  submeshes' indices), each prefab as its mesh, its root's scale and its materials, each material as its texture, its
  alpha cut, the faces it draws and its colour - and each texture as an ATLAS SPEC.
- `Trees/atlases.bin` - the specs' erase lists, packed.
- **No picture.** Every texture in the bundle is Daggerfall's own art: the five small ones are classic records whole
  (501_19, 502_25, 502_30, 506_28 and 508_1), and each larger atlas is classic records of TEXTURE.500-511 copied texel
  for texel - upright or mirrored, cut down in places, now and then turned - for 75-91% of its drawn texels, with the
  author's top-down crowns and some larger side views made from the same records (capped with painted snow on the
  winter atlases), a few touch-ups and a few hand-written record numbers for the rest. A render of game data is game
  data (`bible/01-Overview/Port-Doctrine.md`), so the spec names what to copy - each record, its turn, where it lands,
  the rectangle it paints and where it must not (erase spans, each the whole gap between that copy's own claims, so no
  span traces a record's silhouette) - and the game paints the atlas from the player's own TEXTURE files
  (`src/world/lowPolyTrees.js` `paintAtlas`); every texel a copy claims comes back (the tool checks it). The regions no
  record copies are FILLS: the record they were made from and a coarse map of where they lie (8-texel cells, never
  their picture), painted by the game as a crown folded out of the record, a tiled crop of it or the record stretched
  over the region, whichever the tool found nearer the author's own - near his, not his
  (`bible/01-Overview/Audit-Low-Poly-Trees.md` measures how near).

`tools/lowPolyTreesExtract.mjs` rebuilds every file here but this README from the archive and the player's ARENA2. The
design and the record: `bible/07-Rendering/Low-Poly-Trees.md`.
