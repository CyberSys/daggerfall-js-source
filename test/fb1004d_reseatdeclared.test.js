// RESEAT-DECLARED (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-04d, the town-mods audit: "re-seating a moved quest site turns a house into a
// tavern or shop"). A quest's building site whose town stands in another layout than it was chosen in is chosen again
// in the town as it stands (Place.reseatMovedSite, AUDIT WD3 S5) - by the place's own law. But that law was read off
// the Place's p2, and a house type that found none of its kind falls back to any house and WRITES p2 = -1 into the
// place (SetupLocalSite, Place.cs:735; SelectRemoteTownSite after 250 darts, :815) - and -1 with a p3 of 0 is
// `random`, any valid building (Quests-Places). Measured over the player's own towns: in 40 of Beautiful Villages'
// villages with no House1, `Place _mansion_ local house1` re-seated 125 times landed in House2 86, Tavern 28, House4 10
// and a general store once. The re-seat now reads the place's DECLARED P2/P3 again from Quests-Places by its name, and
// keeps the search's own house fallback (any house) - one search, the setup's and the re-seat's.
