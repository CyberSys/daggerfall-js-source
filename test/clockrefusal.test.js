// CLOCK-REFUSAL (2026-09-22) - THE NO-OP NOBODY COULD SEE.
//
// `advanceWorldMinutes` is refused under the shared clock (WORLD5: the
// world's time is not this player's to move) and it answers a NUMBER
// either way - the shared minute when it refuses, the new minute when
// it moves. So a caller that MEANS the passage of time gets a
// plausible answer back and cannot tell that nothing happened.
//
// THAT HAS ALREADY COST ONE BUG, and it is the reason this file
// exists rather than a comment: DEATHLOOP1's second half was the
// prison release asking for the sentence's days, getting a number, and
// letting the player out at the health they walked in with - which for
// trashBattery, arrested while dying of a fall, was dead, straight
// into a deathloop he had to force-kill the process to escape.
//
// So the law: every caller that asks the world clock to move either
// CONSULTS the refusal or is listed below with the reason it does not
// have to. The list may shrink and never grow silently - a new caller
// fails here.
//
// LIVED1 (2026-09-29) removed the trap at its root: a caller that MEANS
// the passage of time - a sentence, a turn, a cure, a quest's RaiseTime -
// moves the CHARACTER's own clock (worldTick.js advanceOwnMinutes), which
// is theirs online and the one clock offline, and is never refused. No
// caller asks the world's clock to move any more; the refusal stands for
// anything that ever does, and this file holds both halves.

// words (in town, indoors, foes near, no ground, worn out, too many);
