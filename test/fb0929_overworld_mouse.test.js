// FB0929 (field bug, 2026-09-29, Discord #bug-reports, relayed by Mac). Satranath: "Can't free mouse on Overworld
// until after pressing Escape (Y doesn't work) after Overworld update. As title says. Y doesn't free the mouse on
// overworld until after you press Escape."
//
// THE LOCK LANDED UNDER THE OVERWORLD. A browser grants a pointer lock a task AFTER it is asked for - Chromium hands
// the request back with `pointerLockElement` still null and says `pointerlockchange` later - and `releaseLook` lets go
// only of a lock that is HELD. Since "Travel is the Overworld now", a journey begun or resumed on the map raises the
// view on the frame after the map goes down (world.js tvJourneyUp), and that is the very frame whose look gate, on
// the window's close edge, asks for the lock back. The rise frees the cursor (world.js freeCursor: the flag up and
// `releaseLook()`), finds nothing locked yet, and the lock lands a moment later under a view whose cursor is its own:
// the mouse captured, Y refused (the toggle stands down while the view is up - TV1), and only the browser's own
// Escape, which ends any lock, gave it back. The map's Overworld button never raced: its commit raises the view a
// frame BEFORE the look gate's relock, which the freed cursor then refuses.
//
// Driven through the real modules - player/pointerLock.js, scenes/travelView.js, the registry's own Y - with the
// world host's seams READ OUT OF THE SHIPPED SOURCE and run (its cursor toggle, the view's freeCursor, the map's
// Overworld door, the journey's rise), against a browser just real enough: listeners in the order they were added,
// the focus, and a lock granted a task late and let go at once (both measured in Chromium).
