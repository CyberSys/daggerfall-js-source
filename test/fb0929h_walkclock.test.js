// FIELD BUGS 2026-09-29h (WALK-CLOCK) - ThetaDecay: "Guild rank time not advancing (online). I tried traveling back and
// forth between towns, which took 32 total days. I met all the reqs for a guild rank bump and wasn't able to get one."
// Mac, on the batch's first answer: "Dont worry abour DFU."
//
// A guild's 28 days (Guild.cs) are stamped and read on the character's own clock (LIVED1). Online the shared clock is the
// world's and moves for nobody, and the frame's tick reads it alone - so an accelerated walk (Travel Options' walk, the
// Overworld's journey) charged the character's clock its REAL minutes: a thirty-two-day ride, a few hours lived. The
// walk's minutes past the world's are raised on the character's own clock now, the door a rest already uses.
