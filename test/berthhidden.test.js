// BERTH-HIDDEN (2026-10-04 - found chasing Mac's "The classic style ship is broken. its two ships clipped inside of
// eachother", which was the sailing cabin's: test/fb1003b_cabinhull.test.js) - a ship made fast at a port's quay, out of sight,
// read as a free berth. Come Sail Away hides a boat more than a map pixel off
// and every one while the player is indoors (comeSailAway.js UpdateBoatVisibility), and the berths asked only the boats
// it shows: from HARBOUR_STAND (1,200 m off the mouth - two pixels from her, coming in) the port's roll moored its own
// ship at her berth, and as the player came within a pixel she stood again inside it. A berth asks of every boat of
// mine placed outdoors, shown or not (scenes/navalHost.js berthBoats), and of another player's boat hidden under its
// owner at its helm. bible/03-World/Holdings.md section 7.
