// DISC28-E (2026-09-28, Discord: "dying infinitely from fatigue" - the respawn at 0% fatigue, a second player's
// "it gives me a small portion and I collapse again") and DISC28-F (the repeated Criminal Conspiracy arrests whose
// legal reputation never came back).
//
// E: the online revival handed back a body the next tick killed. Two flaws. The fatigue was restored only when it was
// exactly zero, so a death with a sliver left stood up with the sliver. And the minutes spent on the death screen were
// charged to the revived body: the shared clock runs on under the screen with nothing ticking, the markers stood at the
// minute of death, and the first tick after the rise replayed the whole span of stamina drain and needs against the
// half pool just given. DFU charges a dead player nothing (PlayerEntity.cs:352-353 returns before the minute loop).
//
// F: DFU's reputation normalise fires on the exact multiples of 161280 minutes the per-minute loop walks. Online, the
// stamps that end an absence moved the marker to now without walking the span, so a boundary that fell while away was
// lost for good.
//
// Driven through the real tick (tickPlayerMinutes), the real revival door and the real arrival (alignEntityClocks).
