// AUDIT DISC28 (2026-09-28, the pre-merge audit of the 2026-09-28 Discord batch, before the merge) - lane 4, motion.
//
// MO-1: A WALL IS NEVER A FLOOR. DISC28-G stopped a RISING swimmer being set on a ceiling's top face, and the same
// report came true by another road the fix left as it was. PH1's one-way floor read the CONTACT's direction alone -
// within the slope limit of straight down - and the closest point of a wall is not always on its face: a wall quad is
// two triangles, and a sphere pressed into it just under the DIAGONAL is nearest the upper triangle's edge, above its
// centre. The lower sphere was set ON that edge (lifted ~0.4) and, under a ceiling, the ceiling's face was then in reach
// straight above and set the body on the ceiling's top - in the HORIZONTAL pass, which is never a rising one. A swimmer
// holding Space along a wall left the level; a crouched walker in a crawlspace did; a runner along a wall was thrown
// half a metre up. A CharacterController stands only on what its slopeLimit calls walkable, judged by the touched
// triangle's own normal: the one-way floor now asks the face's own plane too (player/collider.js _resolveSphere).
//
// MO-3: ONE STROKE IS ONE SWEEP. The Deep Waters stroke is one CharacterController.Move a frame, however long; the
// port's move() sweeps exactly only up to EXACT_SWEEP_MAX and takes the rest whole. At the Swim Speed Multiplier's top
// a fast swimmer's stroke in a slow frame passed that, and its substeps - wider than the capsule - went up through any
// ceiling. The stroke hands a longer motion over in pieces (scenes/deepWatersSwimMove.js).
//
// Every test here fails on the merge it was written against (2a8b70b2a). Driven through the real collider, the real
// PlayerMotor and the real stroke.
