// online with this one in an older build"; bible/01-Overview/Field-Bugs-2026-09-30.md). The census (realm_census) counts
// a character under the ACCOUNT it went online with - and a player with a guest on one browser and a handle on another,
// or the desktop app beside the web, played one character on two accounts. Customs asked this account's census alone and
// said "no record" of a character the realm DID count, on the other account: the one refusal that sent the player to the
// Discord for a pass they did not need. It names the other account's case now; the gate itself (customsRealm's one
// guarded write) is unchanged, so nothing is let in that was not.
