// SHIP-PORT (2026-09-28, Discord through Mac: "a player is at a port but unable to set sail"). The map's ship passage
// asks Travel Options' IsNotAtPort of the player's location. On their own ship that location is "Your Ship" (2,2 or
// 5,5), which is in neither port list (the mod's 378 harbours; the MAPS byte's 343, every one of them among the 378),
// while every trip from the deck is reckoned from the port the ship was boarded at (playerTravelOrigin,
// TravelTimeCalculator.GetPlayerTravelPosition). So the passage was refused from the deck ("since there's no port")
// and By land walked out onto the sea. Now, on the ship, the ship laws read the boarding port. Two more on the same
// road: the enhanced map's card re-bills a trip whose ship its guard knocked off (it showed By land over the ship's
// fare, and Begin gold-checked that fare). SHIP-SAIL (Mac, of the Overworld taking the map's passage itself: "Shouldn't
// it already function as such?"): where the Overworld refuses a place across the water and the map's passage sails
// there, the Overworld OFFERS the passage and takes it, priced by the map's own popup headless (partyTripFare) - with
// Come Sail Away on or off (AUDIT 28e: it was offered only with the mod on). Every place below is the retail MAPS.BSA's
// own (its region, its index, its pixel, its id); the source pins read CODE (test/codeOnly.mjs).
