// FIELD BUGS 2026-09-30 (TAVERN-DRINK) - #bug-reports, "Climates & Calories Bugs": "most people are disabling the mod
// because of these issues ... 2 - Drinking beverages at an inn/tavern does not fill your hydration. It is supposed to,
// and food works properly, it's only beverages."
//
// A meal snaps the hunger to fed (tavernEat); a drink took forty off a thirst that runs to a hundred and fifty, and its
// quarter hour climbed while it was drunk - a desert inn's juice read 150, 126.7, 103.3, 80, 56.7, four cups to leave the
// red. A Casual thirst loan is repaid only when the thirst leaves red, so it stayed owed through three paid drinks. A
// tavern drink quenches the thirst WHOLE now, whatever its kind; the drunk counter by kind and the quarter hour stand, and
// the host's quarter hour is the minute law's first sight of the met thirst - the loan comes back in the same pick.
