// DISC28-B (2026-09-28, Discord: "the game locks up if guards hit you the moment you fast travel").
//
// Online the world runs under every window (WORLD5), so a guard's blow can raise the surrender box as the travel map
// commits the journey - and the arrival clears the crime (PostFastTravel, world.js) with the box still standing. The
// box then asked about a crime that no longer existed, held the damage veto the whole time, and Y marched the player
// into startCourtFlow, which set `arrested`, opened the modal courtroom and only THEN asked startCourt - whose null (no
// crime: DaggerfallCourtWindow.cs:109-114 closes the court) the plead box dereferenced. The throw left a courtroom
// with no box over it and `arrested` standing: every damage veto on, nothing that could close it. The lockup.
//
// Driven through the real arrest flow, the real court and the one damage door.
