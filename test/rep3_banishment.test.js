// REP3 (2026-09-29, the reputation overhaul) - BANISHMENT, TIMED OR PARDONED. Mac's call: "Timed or pardoned" - "Only
// for Murder and worse. Lifts after about 30 game days (~2.5 real days), or pay for a pardon at the region's palace." The
// pardon is bought at the region's TEMPLE: the watch never enters one, so a banished criminal can reach it (a palace is
// the watch's own ground).
//
// DFU's court rolled banishment for EVERY crime below zero standing (1% at -1, 12% at a first Theft's -8, 28% at a first
// Murder's -20) and nothing ever cleared the bit: a 10% watch roll in that region for the rest of the game.
