// FIELD BUGS 2026-09-30 (WARM-SAID) - #bug-reports, "Climates & Calories Bugs": "your temperature gets to either
// "Scorching" or "Freezing" or "Soaked" etc and seems to never recover".
//
// Since the Tiers' third pass a need's stage line is said when the need WORSENS and never on the way back (needs.js
// stageNote) - right for the stages, and it left the recovery unsaid: a player heard the cold seep into their bones and
// never heard it go, heard they were drenched and never that they were dry. The way out of the red is said now, ONCE:
// leaving scorching for any stage that is not red says "You are cooling down.", leaving freezing or deadly cold says
// "You are warming up.", and a soaking or a drenching dried all the way says "You have dried off." The improving stages
// themselves stay silent, and nothing repeats while the recovery goes on.
