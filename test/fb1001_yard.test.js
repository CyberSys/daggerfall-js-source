// FIELD BUGS 2026-10-01 - HOME-YARD: "Decorating the exterior is bugged for houses." and "Exterior placement bounds
// shouldnt touch roads/pathways". Every pin walks the REAL yard: scenes/homeYards.js createHomeYards over the real
// decorator (scenes/decorTool.js, ui/decorPanel.js), the real pool (scenes/decorRoom.js), the real Collider
// (player/collider.js) and the real account service (the Worker over node:sqlite, test/accountDb.mjs) through the real
// client (net/accountClient.js accountDecor) - in a town of the producers' own (test/fb1001Town.mjs: the real layout,
// setLocationTiles and terrain kernel, the road painter's mask with it).
//   ROAD-LOT       - the lot let a piece stand on the town's street, its paths and the painter's track, and its marked
//                    edge ran across the road: refused now, and the edge runs along the road's side
//   YARD-CORNER    - a piece turned across the house's corner stood through it: the lot asked its corners, never the
//                    ground between them
//   YARD-STALE     - the town's yards read before a write and answered after it stood the yard as it was: the piece
//                    placed vanished (the one removed came back) for a minute
//   YARD-RECENTRE  - the world's recentre runs after the yards' frame and before the draw: every yard drawn (and solid)
//                    a whole pixel off for the crossing's frame
// `01-Overview/Field-Bugs-2026-10-01.md`.
