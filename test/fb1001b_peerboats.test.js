// FIELD BUGS 2026-10-01b - ANOTHER PLAYER'S BOAT. Mac: "Players aren't colliding with other players' boats and can't
// stand on board". Online (CSA-K) another player's boat stood in a player's collider only while that player was ABOARD
// it - PR-WAGON1's "Others' wagons don't block", carried over to boats - so to everyone else her hull was walked and
// swum through and her deck was no floor to step, climb or come up onto (only her ladder's press or a drop onto her
// deck from above boarded her); and the aboard door took only that drop, so a body standing on her own colliders was
// never aboard her and she would sail out from under it. Mac's word sets the law aside for boats: hers is met and
// stood on as my own.
//   PEER-HULL   - her hull and her deck's furniture stand in my collider as my own boat's do, aboard her or not: a
//                 wader is stopped where my hull stops him, a ray across her deck meets her mast, the helm's sweep
//                 meets her as it meets a boat of mine (scenes/world.js csaSyncColliders)
//   PEER-DECK   - I stand on her deck from the first step, as on mine; standing on her is aboard her (the aboard door's
//                 own `on`, scenes/comeSailAwayAboard.js), so her deck carries me as she sails and my place on it is said
//   FOUR-HOSTS  - only the world host's street stands her (scenes/world.js); a building's and a dungeon's frames stand
//                 no one's boat (scenes/worldModes.js, scenes/dungeonContext.js), and the standalone street
//                 (scenes/exterior.js) has no peers
// Every pin runs the REAL modules: Come Sail Away's pool over the vendored hulls (scenes/comeSailAwayPool.js), a peer's
// boat posed off her owner's word (scenes/comeSailAwayPeers.js), the aboard machine (scenes/comeSailAwayAboard.js),
// the world's collider (player/collider.js) and the player's motor (player/motor.js) - with world.js's own
// csaSyncColliders, csaSphereCastAll and csaPeersFrame lifted from its source and run in the frame's order (the motor,
// the mod's step's sync, the peers posed and the deck's carry). `01-Overview/Field-Bugs-2026-10-01b.md`.
