// FIELD BUGS 2026-10-04d BOOK-RISE (the Discord, 2026-10-04: "When using this item, the screen froze; no other key
// would close it. I had to restart the browser. It was while opening a bookshelf inside this house." - a book titled
// "The Hall of Records of Hearthton Manor", "Nothing is written here yet." on its left leaf, BLANK on its right).
//
// No loop hung the tab: the book was OPEN FOR GOOD. The enhanced face's exit() latches `closing` and asks Raum's
// closeBook to shut the cover - and closeBook refuses a book still riding up from below the screen (its 'slide-in',
// the first 260 ms it is seen). The ask was dropped, the latch refused every later one (Escape, E, Enter, a tap, Tab,
// the host's close), the frame only ever finished a close the book had TAKEN, so the book rose, opened and stood; the
// door never reported done, the host kept its pausing slot, every key went to the dead book (F5 among them, which the
// hosts swallow for DFU's character sheet). The shelf's own key is E, the book's exit is E, and the book arrives a
// read of the service later - a second press, or the held key's repeat, lands in the rise.
//
// The pins drive the field's book whole and headless: the seat derived as every client derives it (systems/townSeats.js),
// its Chronicle read through the client's own seat book, the window built by the world host's own expression
// (scenes/world.js hallOfRecords.read), mounted by the host's first draw through the reader's one door (ui/bookDoor.js),
// the real face (ui/enhancedBook.js) and the real vendored book (vendor/raum-book/book.js) on a canvas that paints
// nothing, under a clock the test turns.
