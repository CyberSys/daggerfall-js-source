// FIELD BUGS 2026-10-01 #7 (MOVE-BANK) - "Running jumping climbing dint work passed 100"; Mac: "I dont care about DFU.
// We're our own thing now".
//
// The report reproduces whole on the code before MOVE-REAL (#475): there the spam counter let ten minutes of running at
// Running 110 count 41 uses (~2% of the run), a jump about a quarter of the jumps and a climb a quarter of its checks.
// MOVE-REAL fixed that (ten minutes now count ~2400 uses, every jump, every climbing check). What still failed a runner
// past 100 was the BUCKET: a mastered skill's uses still rode DFU's 20000 tally clamp (PlayerEntity.TallySkill's, which
// keeps the int32 `(uses * reflexesMod) >> 16` shift in range) and raiseSkills' past-100 arm kept less than a point of
// carry - so at four uses a second everything a runner ran past 83 minutes between two rests was thrown away, at level
// 30 a full bucket was 0.68 of the first point however long the run, and a pass that banked more than a point kept 0.99
// of the rest. Past 100 the count is progress's, spent in float: no bucket, and what a pass does not land is kept whole
// (re-priced at the next point's cost) for the next pass to land - one point a pass, as before.
//
// Driven on the producers: a chargen'd character (systems/chargen.js createCharacter over a custom career), mastered
// through systems/masterSkills.js masterSkill, a real PlayerMotor on a real Collider for its speed and its odometer
// object, the real tick (worldTick.js tickPlayerMinutes) for the run's tallies and the real raiseSkills for the rest.
