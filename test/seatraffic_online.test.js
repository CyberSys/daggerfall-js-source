// SEA-TRAFFIC (2026-09-30, Mac: "players arent seeing boats") - online, the sea's traffic is launched by one player of
// those near each other: the lowest id - but only a player ON THE WATER launches any (the director runs for a player at
// a helm, on a deck or swimming). The election counted every player near, so a lower id ashore - still in the port
// town - was elected and launched nothing, and the player sailing out within NAVAL_SHARE_RADIUS of them, not elected,
// met an empty sea. The real naval hosts of two players in a room (test/navalRoom.mjs).
