// LEVEL-PCT (2026-09-28, Discord, dragonatg: "The level progress is inconsistent between the Uis. On GrimoireUi a
// level progress of 93% is only 12/100 on EnhancedPlus."). GrimoireUI is the classic skin under an art pack, so its
// Level box is the classic sheet's (ui/charsheet.js _showLevel), and that box always printed DFU's skill-sum fraction.
// A character ORL1's bar levels (the mod's law, chosen at creation) still has that sum kept (advancement.js
// raiseSkills) but it levels nothing: the Ascension's crown read the bar (12/100), the box the sum (93%). The box now
// reads the character's own law. And its DFU arithmetic is DFU's precision: `float currentLevel` is a single, and in
// a double two spans in fifteen read a point off what DFU's box reads.
