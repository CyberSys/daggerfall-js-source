// HALL-GOLD (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-03, the Patreon chat - a guild of realm characters with "Buy it for Empire of Tamriel:
// 1274880 gold from the treasury" at a house's door: "we have the cash, began with putting it all in guild bank, but then
// when we went to buy it says whats above ... so went and took all out and put in in bank thinking it meant it had to be
// within the realm ... so is this a glitch, or r we not putting gold in right place").
//
// NOT A GLITCH IN THE PATH: the treasury was the right place, and only it (and only the gold realm characters put in)
// pays for a hall. The defect was the words: both refusals - a treasury short of the price, and one holding it in gold
// that does not count - read "The treasury needs N gold put in by realm characters", and "the realm" read as a place,
// so the gold went to a bank account. Now each refusal is its own line, the Guild tab says how much of the treasury can
// buy a hall, and a deposit past one move's cap is held at the button.
