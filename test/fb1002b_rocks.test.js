// FIELD BUGS 2026-10-02b - THE ROCKS' RECORD AUDITED (Mac: "Audit this"). FIELD BUGS 2026-10-02's ROCK-FREE answered
// Come Sail Away's hull sweep part by part (player/collider.js hullSweepAll) - and its audit, through the real
// modules, found it short of Unity's SphereCastAll five ways, and the C#'s own reach a sixth:
//   BETWEEN THE SPOKES - the sweep was nine rays (the centre and eight on her sphere's rim): a rock smaller than the
//                        gap between two met nothing at all. The sphere itself is swept now, face, edges and corners
//                        (sweepSphereTriangle) - its first contact is the exact one
//   SHELF AND STACK    - a part answered once, at its overlap: one model (one MeshCollider) that is a shelf under her
//                        and a stack ahead answered the shelf, the host dropped it as "beneath" her, and the stack
//                        went unmet - she sailed 15.5 m into it. Now nothing wholly under her keel is met at all (the
//                        KEEL LINE, the host's "beneath" rule gone), and the stack answers as a rock alone does
//   A SIDE OVERLAP ONCE - a rock overlapping her side answered both sweeps (the second refused only the zero point,
//                        and the overlap answers where it touches): counted twice, it outweighed the rock ahead and
//                        she slid 15.9 m into that. The second sweep refuses an overlap as it refuses the zero point
//   A MOVER NEVER HOLDS - a boat's bucket unmoved since its bake (no turn: R null) was read as static, and its hull
//                        held a sphere whose centre it closed round - its walls unmet
//   HER OWN, HER KEEL  - the host is handed her keel line (her collider's box's foot under its centre - as she
//                        floats, however the swell pitches her) and her own colliders, which it no longer sweeps
//   ROCK-REACH         - each sweep reached the whole length again past her end (the C#'s, from her centre): a rock
//                        half a hull clear pushed her and refused her helm, and the push answers the SUM - two clear
//                        astern and one clear ahead summed to her way, and she sailed onto the one ahead and through
//                        it. Each sweep reaches her own end now (a departure)
// Each pin is red on the record's own code (e2466e2bd). `01-Overview/Field-Bugs-2026-10-02b.md`.
