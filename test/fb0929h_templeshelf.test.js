// FIELD BUGS 2026-09-29h (TEMPLE-SHELF) - "Can't use Temple library despite meeting rank requirements. I hit rank 4
// (Curate) in the temple of Stendarr and was told that I had library access. Bookshelves were telling me I was the
// wrong rank, though."
//
// The rank law was right (Temple.cs:466-469, Stendarr's library at 4, guildVariants.js). The shelf never reached it:
// DaggerfallBookshelf.ReadBook asks GuildManager.GetGuild(factionID), whose GetGuildGroup (GuildManager.cs:269-291)
// turns a DIVINE's faction - what a temple's building carries, ggroup None in FACTION.TXT - into its first child's
// group, the HolyOrder. The port's openBookshelf read the record's own ggroup, None, so createGuildForGroup answered no
// guild and bookshelfAccess refused every member of every temple at every rank with accessMembersOnly.
//
// The pin runs openBookshelf's own resolution, lifted off worldModes.js, over the real guild modules, a faction record
// shaped as FACTION.TXT's (the divine's ggroup None, the templar order its child) and a membership the real producers
// mint (joinGuild, then the rank the promotion writes).
