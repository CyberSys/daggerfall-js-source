// AUDIT GALLEON (2026-10-02, Mac: "Audit this. It must be perfect") - THE SEA: the branch's runtime changes to the sea's
// captains and the pool her art rides in, each pinned where it had none. Each pin failed on its mutant (the record's
// tools/mutants/auditgalleon_sea.json); the code as it stood (886da9b19) passes them - these laws were right, unpinned.
//   T2    an errand held on its detour too takes the next abeam the other way, and an arriving ship shortens sail from
//         ARRIVE_EASE_M out (SHIP-LIFE A STALL's laws, unreached once the new galleon's first detour cleared its hulk);
//   T3    past her range a side reloading bends in to close on a runner by CHASE_MARGIN of her pace (AUDIT NAV2 F21's
//         bend, whose one kill was the F25 duels' by chance - the five-gun galleon changed them);
//   T4(b) the pool puts her pictures on the texture door as it loads her (her every face drew nothing without them), and
//         uploads her stern gallery's glass as its night glow when her meshes are made;
//   T4(c) a boarding's last leg into a sounded berth skips the lookout only when the boat lies still, her way there is
//         not lost, the berth is open and she is within her lookout's reach of it - each guard on its own.
