// FIELD BUGS 2026-10-02 - ROCK-FREE. Mac, testing sailing: "ships get stuck in the world of daggerfall ocean rocks".
// Come Sail Away's CheckCollision sweeps the hull's half-beam sphere along her length (SphereCastAll); the world's host
// answered it off the collider's own sphereCastAll, Unity's SphereCastAll over a BUCKET as one collider - and a static
// bucket is a pixel's whole ground, every World of Daggerfall rock of it in one. Two traps followed:
//   - a ledge under her (a rock's shelf, its foot in the sea) overlapping her sphere where the sweep starts answered the
//     zero point - a push from the scene's origin, whatever way that lay - and cast no ray at the rest of the pixel: the
//     rock ahead went unmet, and she sailed into it;
//   - once in it, every ray met its inner walls (the collider reads both faces) and pushed her back in, for good.
// Now the host asks the collider's hullSweepAll, collider by collider as Unity's SphereCastAll answers: a bucket's parts
// are its colliders (each addMesh one - a World of Daggerfall object's MeshCollider); a part her sphere overlaps where
// the sweep starts answers once, at its overlap, where it touches (never the zero point); a part that holds her centre
// answers nothing (Unity's sweep reads no back face); every other part is met by the sweep. And in a rock field a third
// held her: the response (systems/comeSailAway.js lateUpdateSailing) took her way OFF what she met as well as into it,
// so a rock astern of a ship sailing away from it held her to its push, a metre a second. The pins, each red on the
// code before - every one through the REAL modules: the collider (player/collider.js), world.js's own csaSphereCastAll
// lifted from its source, and Come Sail Away's runtime over the vendored hulls (test/csaScene.mjs):
//   A LEDGE HIDES NO ROCK - over a ledge she is held off the rock ahead where open water holds her
//   THE LEDGE ALONE       - she sails over it and off it, nothing pushing her
//   ROCK-AWAY             - what she met takes only her way into it: sailing off from a rock astern, or backing off one
//                           ahead, she keeps the way open water gives her (the C#'s response took the way off it too,
//                           and held her to its push, a metre a second, while it lay in her sweep)
//   OUT OF THE ROCK       - a hull standing inside a rock (closed, or open beneath as a rock standing in the ground is)
//                           sails out of it
//   THE SWEEP'S LAW       - hullSweepAll part by part: an overlap answered once where it touches, a pitched sweep
//                           never grazing onto it again, a holding part silent (a shared edge crossed once), a mover
//                           never holding; nothing under her keel
//   THE HOST              - her keel line handed on, an overlap beside her kept where it touches
// Moved by the record's audit (2026-10-02b, `01-Overview/Field-Bugs-2026-10-02b.md`; its own pins in
// test/fb1002b_rocks.test.js): the sweep is the sphere's own (no spokes, so no `pass` for them), a ledge is no rock
// by the KEEL LINE where the host had dropped an overlap "beneath" her, and each sweep reaches her own end (ROCK-REACH)
// - so the rocks of these pins stand inside her own length, and the ledge under her keel.
