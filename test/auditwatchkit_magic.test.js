// AUDIT WATCH-KIT (2026-10-01, Mac: "Just want to audit this to make sure it's perfection") - lens M: the magic of
// COMPANION-KIT (PR #502, my healing and buffs reaching my crew companions), with lens U's U2(a) (his whole through a
// door) and lens D's safety net over the same code. Every finding was re-run before its fix and is pinned here by a
// test that fails on the code as it stood, over the real modules (companionkit.test.js's rig, ALLY-CAST's seams, the
// real companion layer and party):
//
//   WK-M1  a gift has no caster (scenes/hostMagic.js giveToCompanion): his Spell Reflection bounced my heal onto me
//   WK-M2  CastReadySpell's touch gate admits him by the release frame's own pick (castInput)
//   WK-M3  his spells ride with him through every change of place (scenes/crewAshore.js)
//   WK-M4  Light, Detect and Comprehend Languages are the player's alone (systems/allyCast.js companionCastable)
//   WK-M5  the safety net's three holes and its false equivalent (the records in tools/mutants/companionkit.json)
//   WK-M6  a man knocked out is no mark
//   WK-M9  the ready's arms in the click's own order
//   WK-U2  his whole rides with him (crewAshore.js)
//   WK-D   lens D's fresh mutants over the same code - each an untested behaviour, pinned
//
// Mutation-proven: tools/mutants/auditwatchkit_magic.json, and companionkit.json's four.
