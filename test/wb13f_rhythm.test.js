// WB13f (2026-10-01, Mac: "just overall bring more AAA grade polish to what is already developed"): THE RHYTHM - no
// attack more than twice running (with the fighters spread, phase one was the Charge in 36 of 50 attacks, 28 back to
// back: now he walks in, and a walk-in of six seconds breaks the run, so one who keeps away is charged again), and his
// heaviest blows recover longer, in a spent pose a fighter can punish - slower, never
// faster (Mac, WBX: "I dont think making mechanics faster is the play") (bible/11-Multiplayer/World-Bosses.md section
// 20, WB13f).
