// FIELD BUGS 2026-09-29 (the sea) #1 - "The player sprite doesnt seem mounted to the deck when the ship moves around"
// (the Discord, through Mac). Online, only a passenger said where they stood on a boat; the player at their own helm
// was drawn from their world pose - a send behind - while their boat was led ahead by its way, so they trailed the
// wheel. A passenger was stood in the boat's root frame while its owner's deck rocked under them. And a body carried
// by a deck read as walking: the moving bit and the pace were read off the world, where the deck's way is a stride.
