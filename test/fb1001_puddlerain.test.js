// PUDDLE-RAIN (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-01 #1 - "When sinking into a puddle rain isnt shown and disappears from screen").
// The port swims wherever the drawn water is under the feet (MAC2), a puddle record's whole tile among it
// (WATER-PUDDLE kept the feet on DFU's whole tile), and a body on exterior water sinks; DW-D stood the rain, the snow
// and the sand down for any swimmer outdoors (Iliac Puddle No More's UpdateWeatherParticles, IsPlayerSwimming &&
// !IsWaterWalking) - so a body sunk in a puddle, its eye 0.2 m over the water, lost the rain while the rain loop
// played on. The real chain: exteriorSurfaces on a puddle record, exteriorSwimming over the sink, the sea's own
// fogPresentation for an eye inland; then the frame's gate, lifted off world.js and run: what falls is hidden by the
// water over the EYE alone - the distance fog's "under", as the wisps and the bolts already were.
