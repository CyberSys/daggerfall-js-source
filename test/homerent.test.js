// HOME-RENT (2026-09-30, asked: "For houses with multiple rooms, the owner can choose to rent out to other players and
// adjust the price as needed"). A ROOM OF A HOME, RENTED TO ANOTHER PLAYER. The law both ends read (net/homeLaw.js
// RENT_*); the service through the real Worker over node:sqlite with every migration applied (server-account/src/
// rent.js): the owner offers and prices, another player's realm character rents on its record, the rent is held on the
// home and collected by the owner, a sale and a delete wait for the tenants; the client's half (systems/homeRent.js,
// systems/onlineHomes.js): the registry's tenancies and vacancies, the door's rows, a rent paid and given back, the
// rent collected by the service's count; the owner's rooms view in the decorator; the host's wiring by source.
