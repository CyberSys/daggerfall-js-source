// FIELD BUGS 2026-09-29h (SPAWN-PLATE) - "Elite Dungeons that despawn stay on map. Got two of them like this that have
// despawned with no entrance anymore but are still marked on overworld map!"
//
// A spawn's time runs out (TTL1: seven days from first sight, two from its clearing - the ledger's clocks, never while
// the player is in it); the next build of its pixel takes it out of the index and builds the pixel EMPTY
// (_locationToBuild). The Overworld marks a FOUND spawn off the discovered-places store, which files it for good, and
// asked `tvSpawnGone` whether it was gone - which excused a spawn on a BUILT pixel ("one standing on built ground stands
// until that ground is next built", AUDIT OW5b D2). A pixel built after the clock ran out is built, and empty: the
// excuse kept the plate over bare grass, and its walk, whenever the traveller came within the grid of it.
//
// The pin runs the two host functions lifted off world.js, over the real ledger, through the report's own sequence.
