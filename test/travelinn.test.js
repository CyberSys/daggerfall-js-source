// TRAVEL-INN (2026-09-22) - WHAT THE INNS/CAMP OUT TOGGLE ACTUALLY DOES,
// MEASURED ON BOTH SIDES.
//
// DragynDance on Discord: "when you use instant travel the game ignores
// the option to camp or rest at an inn". Mac: "there's a toggle to rest
// at inns and stuff during travel. Why doesn't it work?"
//
// It works OFFLINE and it is inert ONLINE, and neither half was written
// down anywhere an execution could check. The numbers below are driven
// out of the real popup rather than argued from the source, because the
// chain is four modules long - the popup's refresh, travel.js's
// per-pixel charge, the trip cost, and the host's arrival minute - and
// a reading of any one of them proves nothing about the other three.
//
// OFFLINE the toggle is fully live: camping out is SLOWER (travel.js
// charges `(300 * thisMove) >> 8` per pixel when you are not paying for
// a bed, classic-verbatim) and free, staying at inns is faster and
// costs gold.
//
// ONLINE both consequences collapse to nothing. WORLD5 makes the clock
// the world's, so the trip takes no world time (world.js's arrival is
// `sharedClockOn() ? worldMinutes() : worldMinutes() + computed.minutes`)
// and OL2 pays no inn night because there are no nights. The day
// countdown reads 0 and the fare reads 0 whichever way the toggle is
// set - so on the instant path the player's choice really is ignored,
// exactly as reported. The window says so in both skins
// (ONLINE_TRAVEL_LINE). Offline the toggle still decides whether the trip
// is WALKED or instant; online (TRAVEL-ONLINE, 2026-10-03) the room holds
// Travel Options' Inns dial, so a trip over land is walked either way and
// the toggle decides the road's nights alone.
//
// This pin exists so that stays true by execution. If a later slice
// makes the online trip spend time, the offline rows here will not
// move and the online rows will - which is the signal to come back and
// decide what an inn means when the nights belong to everyone.
//
// LIVED1 (2026-09-29) IS THAT SLICE, and the answer is the character's
// own time: the nights belong to the traveller. The trip's days pass on
// their own clock (world.js advances them online too), so an inn is a
// bed they sleep in and camping out is the slower road again - the
// toggle is fully live online, as offline. The offline rows did not
// move; the online rows did, and now read the same.
