// RATIONS-HUNGRY (2026-10-03, Mac: "With C&C let it auto consume any rations in inventory when hungry"). Climates &
// Calories' rations in the pack were eaten by themselves only once the player was STARVING (a day without a meal, and
// starving's fatigue and Hard's stat loss on the way); now a sack is eaten as the player turns HUNGRY (12 hours). Not at
// Peckish - a sack is a full meal - and never for a vampire, nor with the host's autoEat off. Over a jump (a rest, a
// journey) the walk eats one each time it turns Hungry, as many as the pack holds. survival/needs.js AUTO_EAT_STAGES.
