// MAC-LVL1 (2026-09-21, a player: "been jumping back and forth between
// online/offline, and it seems to me that leveling doesn't work
// properly online. I assume it probably has to do with how online
// changes the passage of time"). He was right about the cause. DFU's
// RaiseSkills (PlayerEntity.cs:1359-1414) opens its 360-minute gate
// (:1367) against world time, and its only two callers - the rest
// window (:731) and fast travel (:380) - have JUST raised that time.
// Online the world clock is the shared wall clock (WORLD5) and a rest
// no longer moves it: an 8-hour rest takes 3.6 real seconds = 43
// shared minutes, the gate stayed shut, and the second, third and
// fourth rests of a heal-up loop advanced nothing. The rest's
// simulated minutes are CREDITED to the skill-check clock now.
//
// LIVED1 (2026-09-29) retired the credit and kept the law: the gate
// reads the CHARACTER's own clock (worldTick.js ownMinutes), which the
// rest's hours move online as the one clock moves offline - so a night
// opens it by RaiseSkills' own arithmetic, and nothing is banked on the
// entity, spent at the rest's end or carried in the save.
