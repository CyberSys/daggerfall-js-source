// FIELD-CONSOLE1 (2026-09-27) - A PLAYER'S CONSOLE, READ LINE BY LINE. Two of its lines were faults:
//
//   [town] FACTION.TXT unavailable: Cannot access 'Ut' before initialization
//     townTalk's load (built far up bootWorld) resumes after its FACTION.TXT fetch and reads the region through
//     `_questRegionIndex` - which was a `const` declared thousands of lines below, AFTER `await loadQuestPack()`.
//     bootWorld is suspended at that await when the fetch lands, so the read hit the dead zone and the region's
//     people never loaded: every town talk ran without its people. It is a hoisted declaration now.
//
//   /assets/undefined 404 (twice at boot, twice at every door)
//     Handheld Torches' two loaders probe frames until one is missing - the mod's own TryImportTexture loop -
//     and in the bundle a frame past the last has no file, so Vite's dynamic URL is `/assets/undefined` and the
//     probe's miss went out as a request. The vendored set is known at build time; a frame not in it is a miss.
