// SWIM-EYE (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-02c, Discord: "Sinking in water causes clipping underground. I sunk into some water in
// the overworld and could see sky and mountains underground") - a sunk swimmer's eye stood 0.20 over his feet, the
// port's "0.1 under the 0.30 top" where DFU's DoSinking sets the camera at controller.height / 2 over the controller's
// centre - a sphere's, CAPSULE_RADIUS over the feet: 0.50. The swim bounce (headBobber.js, DFU's own, re-armed every
// cycle in the water) dips it BOUNCE_MAX, so it sank to 0.03: under the drawn ground and inside the world's 0.2 near
// plane, and the one-sided terrain vanished over the sky; at the sea's own height Deep Waters' 0.25 band read it as
// underwater. Pinned by the real bobber's own cycle against the world's own lens and the mod's own band, read from the
// source. Red on the record's code (42e50765).
