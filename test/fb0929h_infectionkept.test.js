// FIELD BUGS 2026-09-29h (INFECTION-KEPT) - Julian: "Lycanthropy still tied to server clock. I was able to rest to
// activate the initial 'you dream of the moon' dream. but for the next phase ... resting did not progress the disease.
// during this time i had gotten another disease from a dungeon and had to cure it which likely wiped my lycanthropy
// progress." Mac, on the batch's first answer (that the cure ending the infection is DFU's own law): "Dont worry abour
// DFU."
//
// The incubation runs on the character's own clock and an online rest moves it (LIVED1, test/lived1.test.js) - the
// dream came, and the turn waits for the fourth day. What ended it was the cure: DFU stores an infection as a disease
// bundle, and CureAllDiseases ended it with the plague caught beside it. A cure of disease takes the plain diseases
// first now - the temple's (paid or free), a spell's and a potion's alike - and the infection only when it is all there
// is, so a player who wants rid of it still cures it before the turn; the temple prices what it takes. The turn's own
// CureAll of the old life still ends every disease there is.
