// AUDIT WORLD5 (Mac, 2026-09-13: "Lets do an audit on this") - four opus
// lenses over WORLD5 (the wire, the relay and what the player is told; the
// weather and the boot; the clock and the ticker; the rest, the travel and
// the quests), each told the live report and made to find it. Fourteen
// findings fixed, the rest recorded. THE FIXES EXECUTE: the dungeon's rest
// arm no longer runs a rested night's rounds twice (C1 - its own claim moved
// the broker's marker past the tick's last reading, and the tick's backstop
// took the reading for a load); a source that steps backwards re-anchors
// rather than freezing every tick (C2); the alignment is a SHIFT of every
// marker the save carries, not a stamp of four (C3 - a save further along
// than the world raised no skill and trained nowhere for real days); a load
// online is an arrival through save.js's one door (C4); the shared roll is
// the day's, stamped at its first minute and its evolution replayed from its
// first hour (C5); the collapse pays its hour once a world hour (C6); a
// covered rest loses the world's time and a leap is taken a sub-tick a frame
// (C7); the sub-tick's span rides to the host (C8); and by source: the
// dungeon arm's span (C8), the sentence refilling nothing (C9), exterior.js's
// stand-down word (C10), the welcome's clock stamped as it is built (C11),
// the pane's copy (C12), the install at the top of the boot (C13), the
// cautious heal offline only (C14).
//
// LIVED1 (2026-09-29, Mac: "We need a better system for time online instead of a band aid fix") re-aims the pins
// whose laws it retired, each in its own place: the claim is the character's and moves no world reading (C1), an
// arrival moves nothing of the character's (C3, C4), the collapse pays its hour in full (C6), the session hands its
// minutes alone (C7, C8), the sentence refills in both lanes (C9), the pane says the character's own time (C12), the
// cautious heal is the trip's nights online too (C14). What each held and still holds is kept beside it.
