// FIELD-RAID-FT (2026-09-28, Discord, lumin: "Fast traveled to a raid and got a crash" - "TypeError: Cannot read
// properties of null (reading 'filter') at Object.peersInTown"). A fast travel leaves the old cell's room before the
// new one opens, and `peersNear()` answers null while no room is open; the raids' host seam walked it, so arriving in
// a raided town (the raid's Update runs its election the first frame the player stands in the town) threw out of the
