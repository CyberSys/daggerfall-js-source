// DISC28-G (2026-09-28, Discord, in Veraten: "the swimming physics persisted after leaving the water ... I rose way up
// and then fell into the void").
//
// Not a stale swim flag - every dungeon host re-reads it from the player's own block each frame, and DFU's test is
// height alone against a water plane that covers the whole block. The swimmer TUNNELLED UP THROUGH A CEILING that was
// under that plane. A swimmer is crouched to 0.9 (axis 0.2) and a move is stepped at up to 0.2625, so a stroke up into
// a ceiling brought the LOWER sphere within its radius of the face while the head was still beneath it - and PH1's
// one-way floor, which is right for a body straddling a floor, set the whole body ON the ceiling's top. Outside the
// level, still under the block's water plane, the player swam on up with nothing to meet, then out of the water, and
// fell with no floor under the dungeon. DFU's CharacterController sweeps and never crosses a plane.
//
// A rising pass now meets ceilings: the one-way floor is a floor only below the head's centre. Driven through the real
// collider, the real motor and the real Deep Waters stroke.
