// FIELD BUGS 2026-09-30b (TV-SURF) - a screenshot, no words: the Overworld (the travel view, TV1) over a coast, the sea
// laid over with light-blue rectangles, straight-edged, pixel-aligned, over open water and low shore.
//
// They are Come Sail Away's breakers (CSA-F): from each water pixel the mod lays a flat strip toward every land
// neighbour, a quarter-pixel inside the water out to the land pixel's centre, 0.1 m over the sea, within Waves.Distance
// pixels of the player - surf from a ground eye (DFU has no raised camera), the strip seen edge-on. From the travel view's
// 150-450 m it is seen whole: its texels minified, the 29 sea #4 Bayer dither makes it a half-tone sheet - the
// screenshot's checker over the plain sea. The travel view waits the surf for the traveller's eye, as it waits the grass;
// the waves' state (the currents, the helm's neighbours) is untouched - only the drawing.
