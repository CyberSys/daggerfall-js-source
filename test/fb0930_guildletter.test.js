// GUILD-LETTER (2026-09-30, FIELD BUGS 2026-09-30 - a player's list: "cant withdraw gold from guild over wieght limit
// (good place to see if anyone stored cheated gold, was able to store gold befor the empires customs) should be able to
// take note of credit"). A guild treasury's withdrawal was paid in coin whatever it weighed: the Guild book credited the
// purse (scenes/world.js's guild wallet, court.js addGold) and the service the record's purse (net/realmGoldLaw.js
// creditSave) - and a move is up to 1,000,000 gold, 2,500 kg, with Roleplay & Realism's encumbrance on online. The bank
// refuses what cannot be carried, and the trade window pays it as a letter of credit (tradeModes.js sellProceeds). The
// treasury pays as the trade window does: what the pack cannot carry comes as the game's own letter, worth the whole
// withdrawal, no commission taken - written on the record by the service and in the pack by the book, the same letter.
