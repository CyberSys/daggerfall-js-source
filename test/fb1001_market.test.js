// FIELD BUGS 2026-10-01 #2 - MARKET-KEEP: "The market doesn't allow you to list any item that isnt bound, also it's
// bugged". A crafted piece another player handed over - a realm trade moves the piece between the two saves and never
// the product's owner (Professions-Arc 18's hand-over is unbuilt), and a shop's shelf, a room's container and a looted
// body hand one on without the service at all - was taken out of its holder's pack when they pressed List, the service
// said "not yours to sell" (its record names its maker), and the market book never put it back: AUDIT 31 H1 read every
// `market-not-yours` as "the save's piece is a copy". It was their only one, gone. The same for a commission's Fill
// (net/writBook.js shares the list). Driven through the real Worker over node:sqlite (test/accountDb.mjs), the piece
// made at the real anvil (net/profBook.js craft, systems/smithItems.js mintPieces) and handed on by the realm trade's
// own law (net/realmTradeLaw.js settleRealmTrade - the service settles with it).
