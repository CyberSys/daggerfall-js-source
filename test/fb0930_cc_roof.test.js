// FIELD BUGS 2026-09-30 (ROOF-SHELTER) - #bug-reports, "Climates & Calories Bugs": "1 - The player characters
// temperature seems to never change. Whether you are appropriately clothed for your region, indoors, etc. your
// temperature gets to either "Scorching" or "Freezing" or "Soaked" etc and seems to never recover".
//
// The minute tick is not stuck: temperature.js recomputes the felt reading every minute. The rule held it. Indoors the
// natural temperature was half the climate and the season and nothing else - no hour - so a desert inn at eleven at night
// read 30 while the street outside it read 0: in from the sand, a Redguard in the starting kit felt 35, Hot, all night,
// and the chip never lifted. Inside a building the natural temperature is now the MILDER of the street's own now (climate,
// season, hour and weather, as outdoors) and the roofed half; a tie is the roof's. A roof never makes it hotter or colder
// than the street. Underground is unchanged.
