// FIELD BUGS 2026-10-02 - SEA-HELD. Mac, testing sailing: "your ship can get stuck at sea in place". With Deep Waters on
// (Iliac Puddle No More), Come Sail Away reads a node as water by its ground's height, Terrain.SampleHeight under 34 m -
// and the open sea stands 6 mm under that line (step 579, 33.994 m: FIELD-CSA2). World of Daggerfall levels a site's
// ground AFTER the tiles are read (LocationLoader.AddLocation on OnPromoteTerrainData), lerping EVERY sample of its pixel
// toward the site's mean by 1 / (distance + 1): one rock field on a headland lifts the whole pixel's sea over the line,
// while its tiles stay water and Deep Waters carves and draws a sea there. Every node read land, the boat was beached
// (more than three nodes off water) and nothing moved her; and the C# reads her nodes only when she moves, so she lay
// there for good. And a bow run onto a shore could not back off it: the oars' astern asked the BOW's node. The pins,
// each red on the code before:
//   BEACH-READ  - a beached boat's nodes are read again each frame she lies still: when the ground under her is put
//                 right (her pixel built again under her) she comes off; a beach stays a beach
//   ASTERN      - back asks the STERN's node, the water she backs into: a bow on a shore backs off it, a stern on one
//                 refuses
// Its SEA-SHOAL (a carved cell's ground read as its seafloor) was struck by the record's audit (2026-10-02b): Deep
// Waters' real carve never carves a sea lifted over the line, so it read land still - the sea is kept at its source
// now, the flatten's (SEA-LEVEL, test/fb1002b_sealevel.test.js).
// Every pin runs the real modules: the sampler's sea (world/terrainSampler.js), Unity's SampleHeight
// (world/terrainSurface.js), world.js's own csaTerrainOf, and Come Sail Away's runtime over the vendored hulls
// (test/csaScene.mjs).
