// GIFT-QUIET (2026-10-04: "sometimes theres notification spam when putting a spell on companion. Ensure there's no
// leftover notifications"): a gift's lines - the armed ready's ("Press button to fire spell." and "Aim at your
// companion..."), the caster's ("You cast Heal on Hilda.") and a party mate's on the receiving end ("Bran casts Heal on
// you.") - are said at most once in GIFT_LINE_QUIET_S of real time (systems/allyCast.js createGiftLineGate;
// scenes/hostMagic.js sayGift and sayArm; scenes/world.js online.onCast). Each was a new toast every cast and told apart
// from the line before it, so the notice stack's repeat guard (ui/hudText.js NOTICE-SPAM: the back row only) never
// caught them - a heal cast again and again near a companion stacked three plates a cast in the Enhanced notice panel.
// The 2026-10-04 audit: an arm unlike the last ready's is said whatever the window, and asking inside the window does
// not hold a line back longer.
