// AUDIT PRE-MERGE 0929 (2026-09-29, Mac: "Audit this") - WB8's half: a Soul-Hungry Warden fed only by a fall with a
// real part behind it, and never more than GATE_FEEDS_MAX times a fight; a Colossal Warden's Cleave reaching wherever he
// chooses it; the marks found once, not re-read every frame. The record: bible/01-Overview/Audit-PreMerge-0929.md and
// bible/11-Multiplayer/World-Bosses.md section 13.
//
// Each test failed on the unfixed tree for its finding's reason: twenty-five throwaway accounts healed him from a fifth to
// all but full (W1-1); a still fighter 9.1 m from a Colossal Warden was cleaved at 39 times in two minutes and struck by
// none (W1-2); a marks array changed in place was read anew (W2-2).
