// AUDIT NAV2 (combat) - the naval second pass's deep audit, its friend-and-foe lens: who the player's own harm and his
// crew's own harm may reach, through the doors a boarding fight actually opens.
//
//   F54  A failed pickpocket (Steal mode) on one of the player's own hands ran only the motor half of
//        MakeEnemyHostileToAttacker: his target became the player and his team stayed PlayerAlly, so he was still a
//        shipmate - he beat the player while the swing, the shaft and the spell all passed through him. A shipmate is
//        no mark (the arm refuses him); any other ally that catches the player's hand is reverted - that call's player
//        arm IS the ally revert - and is fair game.
//   F55  A worn Vampiric Effect (At Range) drained every body within 2.25 m through the world's foe sink at the
//        player's provenance: a shipmate beside him was drained and turned on him, and a prize's yielded men were
//        un-surrendered (the drain woke the area). DFU's VampiricEffect writes CurrentHealth and raises no attack; the
//        spared are passed by; and the encounter pool's damage door itself refuses a shipmate the player's harm.
//   F56  A crewman's AreaAroundCaster spell struck the player and his mates: the cast executor's caster wrapper carried
//        no foe, so the one engine could not tell the blast was a crewman's.
