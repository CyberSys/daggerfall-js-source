// RENOWN3 (2026-09-25, Mac: "Whats the solution to this? Like a high level character shouldnt blow through online
// levels" - and, offered a foe read at most three levels above the character's Renown, "Yes"): A FOE PAYS BY YOUR
// RENOWN. A career foe stands at the character's own Daggerfall level and a quest is sized to it, so a character that
// levelled offline fought level-30 foes from its first minute online and took Renown 10 in 19 kills. Both are now read
// no higher than RENOWN_OVER_MAX above the character's Renown (net/renown.js renownCeiling), which rises with every
// level; a character new to Daggerfall fights at or under the ceiling almost from its first kill and earns what it did.
// RENOWN-ACCOUNT (2026-09-28) paid every source three quarters of it (net/renown.js renownRate), and read the ceiling
// against the ACCOUNT's Renown - the numbers below are at that rate. `06-Systems/Accounts-And-Cloud-Saves-Arc.md` RENOWN3.
