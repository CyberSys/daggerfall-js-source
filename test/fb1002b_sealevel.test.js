// FIELD BUGS 2026-10-02b - THE LIFTED SEA, AT ITS SOURCE (Mac: "Audit this"; "Controls for the player vessel are
// currently broken, including not being able to lower sails"). FIELD BUGS 2026-10-02's SEA-SHOAL read a carved cell's
// seafloor where World of Daggerfall's flatten had lifted a pixel's sea over Come Sail Away's 34 m line - and its
// audit found it inert: Deep Waters' REAL hole mask carves a cell only where its four corners stand at the ocean's
// height (34.019 m at most), so it carved none of the lifted sea, and every node there still read land. The ship lay
// beached at sea, her sails refused at every press ("Unable to raise sail. Boat is obstructed.") - her helm dead. Struck,
// and the sea kept at its source:
//   SEA-LEVEL    - the flatten (world/wodLocationLoader.js flattenForLocation) never raises the sea past SEA_RAMP
//                  samples of the site's own ground: the site's ground is the mod's, a ramp down to the water within
//                  SEA_RAMP, and past it the sea as the sampler left it - Deep Waters carves it, every node reads it,
//                  and her sails go up at the key
//   PLACE-AFLOAT - a water tile standing over the sea's line (a town's harbour basin at its ground's height) is no
//                  water her nodes can read: placing her there is refused with a word, where she was placed and lay
//                  beached from the first frame
// Every pin runs the real modules: the sampler's sea (world/terrainSampler.js), the mod's flatten, Unity's
// SampleHeight (world/terrainSurface.js), Deep Waters' hole mask (world/deepWaterFloor.js), world.js's own csaTerrainOf
// lifted from its source, and Come Sail Away's runtime over the vendored hulls (test/csaScene.mjs). Each is red on the
// record's own code (e2466e2bd). `01-Overview/Field-Bugs-2026-10-02b.md`.
