// PUPPET-GLIDE (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-02d, Discord: "Ai ships move very janky and quick") - another player's ship was
// eased straight onto each of her stander's words (PUPPET_EASE) and run on from the moment the word ARRIVED, so a word a
// little late or early - a relay's 50-400 ms - moved the point she eased to by her way times the difference: a galley
// at 4 m/s was drawn at up to 10, lurching each word and stepping astern. At a steady latency she was smooth, which is
// all test/navalRoom.mjs had ever sent. Now, under way, she sails on at her word's way along her own heading and the gap
// is taken up at PUPPET_CATCH, capped (scenes/navalHost.js). Two real hosts over the pool, a relay of their own that
// keeps the word's order (a socket's) and jitters its latency. Red on the record's code (42e50765).
