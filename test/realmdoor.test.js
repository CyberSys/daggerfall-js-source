// REALM-DOOR (2026-09-29, the field - bible/01-Overview/Field-Bugs-2026-09-29b.md). Gryphoth, on the Discord, to Mac:
// "I was playing online on a new character, went to trade with someone and it said my client was outdated. So I logged
// out, updated and when I logged back in my character was no longer online, and when I go to bring him online it says
// he has no renown or guilds and cant be brought online."
//
// THE ROOT CAUSE. The realm (REALM P1, on main at f4dc60ce, 2026-09-28 23:38:54 UTC) was the NEW BUILD's law alone: its
// boot refuses to take a local slot online (world.js `realmRefused`) and its Online door lists realm characters only.
// Neither server ever asked. The account service minted an identity token for whatever character a client named, and
// the relay admitted any token it could verify - it did not change at all (world124 before and after). So a build from
// before the realm - a tab left open, or the desktop app's portable exe and macOS copies, which never update themselves -
// went on playing online exactly as before, a character made after the census froze included, and nothing told its
// player until a realm-era peer refused a trade ("They are playing an older build"). Everything that character did
// online lives in a local slot the realm cannot admit: the census is frozen at the realm's start (AUDIT REALM L1-F5),
// so customs answers `customs-never-online`, as the census law says it must.
//
// THE FIX. The door asks the realm. The service signs whether the character a mint names is one of the account's realm
// characters (`rc`: 1, else 0 - net/identityToken.js), and the relay refuses a hello whose token says 0 with
// REALM_DOOR_WORD (net/wire.js), which a build from before the realm prints on its HUD and under its chat as it is, and
// stops retrying on. A token with no `rc` is a service from before this slice - the two Workers deploy on their own - and
// is admitted as it was. A realm-era tab names the realm character it joined, and one the door refuses anyway (its
// character deleted, its account changed under it) goes to the Online door with the realm's word.
//
// The real account Worker over the real migrations (node:sqlite behind a D1-shaped face, as test/fb0929_customs.test.js
// drives it) and the real relay Room (test/fakeRoom.mjs), under ONE key pair: the tokens the relay reads are the ones the
// service minted.
