// RESTORE (2026-09-29, Mac: "I want people to get their stuff back") - THE HOUSES A DELETED CUSTOMS CHARACTER TOOK WITH IT,
// PLANNED BACK FROM THE DATABASE'S OWN HISTORY.
//
// From CUSTOMS-CARRY's arrival on main (2026-09-29 03:09:50 UTC) until HOUSE-LOSS, customs carried an offline
// character's online home, guild place and Renown track to its realm id before the first save was sent, and the door's
// Delete on a character whose first save never landed took them with it - the home's pieces and hidden furniture by the
// tables' cascade - and left the census spent (bible/01-Overview/Field-Bugs-2026-09-29.md, HOUSE-LOSS). Those rows are
// gone from the database; D1 Time Travel still holds them. The operator's workflow (.github/workflows/realm-restore.yml)
// reads a snapshot from before the loss (THEN) and the database as it stands (NOW), and this plans what comes back.
//
// MAC'S CALL, AS ASKED ("To the offline character"): everything a deleted customs character took comes back to the
// OFFLINE character it came from - the home with every piece and its hidden list, the guild place, the track - and the
// census is unspent, so the character can be brought in again and customs carries them across, as HOUSE-LOSS's undo
// does from now on. An account whose deleted character TRADED in the realm is HELD for Mac: a character brought in again
// brings its offline items again, and what it traded away would then stand twice. Nothing another player holds now is
// taken back: a building someone else bought since is reported, never written.
//
//   node tools/realmRestore.mjs --then then.sql --now now.sql --out restore.sql [--handles handles.json] [--summary s.md]
//
// `then.sql` and `now.sql` are `wrangler d1 export` dumps of the tables below; `handles.json` is `wrangler d1 execute
// --json` of `SELECT id, handle FROM players` (a report names players by handle, never by id). The SQL written is
// idempotent - INSERT OR IGNORE, and an UPDATE guarded by the census's own law - so a run cut short is run again.
