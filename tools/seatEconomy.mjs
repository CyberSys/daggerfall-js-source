// SEAT1d (2026-10-01, Mac: "Finish the seats"; "Continue") - THE ECONOMY MODEL, AS A TOOL (bible/06-Systems/
// Professions-Arc.md Appendix C: "SEAT1d ships the model as a tool reading townSeatLaw.js and professionLaw.js
// directly, so every later balance pass is re-run, not re-guessed"; Seats-Arc 13: "the model re-runs Appendix C's
// table").
//
// A seeded Monte Carlo of a guild's week: its members drawn from Appendix C's three players (35% casual, 45% regular,
// 20% hardcore), each one's influence at its pledged seat counted by the law's own sources and caps (the Watch, gate
// receipts, Renown in the region, the Siege Camp's writs at a Mark of influence a Mark, the account's cap), and its
// Court writ income by the law's own writ (its units by tier, its pay, the day's cap). The guild's week is the sum; the
// table is each size's p10 / p50 / p90 influence, its median writ income, and what a palace's and a crown's upkeep take of
// it. Every number the law owns is read from it - change a cap there and the table moves here.
//
// The players are ASSUMPTIONS (Appendix C's table), kept here and named: MEASURED replaces them with the weekly
// report's own after four weeks of Marks.
