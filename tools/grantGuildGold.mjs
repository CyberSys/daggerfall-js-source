// GUILD-GRANT (2026-10-03, Mac: "Can we award the empire of tamriel guild 1.6mil gold") - GOLD INTO A GUILD'S TREASURY,
// AWARDED BY THE OPERATOR. No route mints gold into a treasury, and on purpose: every gold piece in one was carried in
// by a member (GUILD1), and only what realm characters carried in buys a hall or comes back out (AUDIT REALM L1-F3,
// `realm_gold`). So an award is the operator's, written once, by hand, through .github/workflows/guild-grant.yml:
//   1. a dry run reads the guild the name finds - its tag, its members, its treasury and the part of it that buys a
//      hall - and nothing is written;
//   2. the run with apply on writes the award: the treasury AND `realm_gold`, so the gold buys a hall and a realm
//      character can take it out like any other, and the guild's own ledger says who put it there (`grant`, by
//      GRANT_BY - the Guild tab's line, src/ui/socialPanel.js GUILD_LEDGER_WORDS).
//
//   node tools/grantGuildGold.mjs --look <guild name>          the dry run's statement: the guild as it stands
//   node tools/grantGuildGold.mjs --sql <guild name> <gold>    the award's statement, as guild-grant.yml runs it
//
// A guild is found by its name key (guildLaw.js guildNameKey: the case, the spaces and the punctuation aside), the key
// the service holds unique - so "empire of tamriel" typed into the workflow is the Empire of Tamriel, and no other.
