// CSA-A (2026-09-27): IS A LARGE PICTURE BUILT OUT OF CLASSIC TEXTURES?
//
// Detailed Ships' search (tools/detailedShipsAssets.mjs findClassicSource)
// asks whether ONE classic record covers a picture of about its own size. A
// mod's 640x640 animation frame is no record's size, so that search passes
// it without looking. This one looks: the picture is cut into aligned blocks
// of each square record size the TEXTURE files use (32, 64, 128), and every
// record of that size is laid on every block; the best share of a block's
// VISIBLE pixels a record matches exactly (RGB; a clear pixel never draws,
// so it is neither a match nor a miss) is the answer. A block less than a
// quarter visible is not judged - a few pixels agree with anything. DS1's bar, DERIVED_SHARE of the block,
// is the line between a picture that happens to share a palette's greys and
// one made of a record.
//
// Laid naively that is billions of comparisons, so a record is first bounded
// by colour: it can match no more of a block than the pixels whose colours it
// has at all, counted with their multiplicity on both sides. A record whose
// bound is under the bar is skipped unread.
//
// A FLAT RECORD PROVES NOTHING, so it is not laid at all. TEXTURE.000 is a
// shelf of single-colour swatches (the flat faces of Daggerfall's models),
// and a block that is mostly one grey of the palette "matches" the swatch of
// that grey as far as it is that grey - Come Sail Away's waves reach 59% of a
// 32x32 block against TEXTURE.000 record 119 that way. A record one colour
// covers FLAT_SHARE of is a swatch, and the search says which it skipped.
