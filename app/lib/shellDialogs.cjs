// AUDIT INSTALL (lane 5 #1, 2026-09-29): THE SHELL'S QUESTIONS, AND WHICH
// ANSWER DOES WHAT.
//
// Each of these asks the player before something they cannot take back:
// leaving a game with progress at risk (UNLOAD-ASK), restarting it into an
// update, fetching an installer. The audit found nothing held the ANSWERS:
// "Not now" wired to restart, Escape bound to Restart, Enter bound to
// Leave, or the two labels swapped, each passed every suite and the probe.
// So the buttons, the default (what Enter presses) and the cancel (what
// Escape and the window's close press) are data here, the answer that
// DOES the thing is one predicate beside them, and
// test/audit_install.test.js holds both: the safe answer is always the
// cancel, and on UNLOAD-ASK the default too - Enter must not throw an
// evening away.
//
// Pure, no Electron: app/main.cjs passes these to dialog.showMessageBox*.
