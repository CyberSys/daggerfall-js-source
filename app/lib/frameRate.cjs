// FPS-VSYNC (2026-09-28, Mac, asked whether the desktop app should run above the screen's refresh: "Yes").
//
// DFU's own law (StartGameBehaviour.cs:238-250): VSync ON, every frame waits for the screen and the Frame Rate Cap
// does nothing; VSync OFF, frames do not wait, and the cap is what holds them (under 30 it is off: they run free). A
// page cannot stop waiting - every requestAnimationFrame waits for the screen, which is why `Video/VSync` is
// unavailable in the browser build (src/systems/settings.js) and the cap there only holds frames back
// (src/systems/frameCap.js). The desktop app's Chromium CAN stop waiting, if it is told before it starts. So the shell
// reads the player's own saved setting at launch - the same store the page writes (the `dagger.settings.v1` pref,
// Prefs/ under userData, through the page's own file store) and the same reading (SettingsManager.GetBool:
// 'true', any case, is on; anything else stored is off; nothing stored is DFU's default, on) - and, with VSync off,
// lifts the wait. The page's cap then does the holding, exactly as DFU's targetFrameRate does. A change is read at
// the next start; the settings screen says so (TIER_TEXT.restart).
