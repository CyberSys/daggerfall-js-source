// PARTY-MAP (2026-09-30, Discord: "share map data between party members, possibly with a spell effect so that
// maintaining some kind of buff for it becomes part of the dungeoneering loop"; and, from another player, "makes a
// dedicated scout more viable and helps non-combat characters contribute"): SHARED CARTOGRAPHY.
//
// THE EFFECT. `Shared Cartography` (46,255 - the port's own; no classic key uses 46, RESURRECT1's 45 is the
// precedent) is a Mysticism duration buff, CasterOnly, a BUFF_KINDS row (systems/effects.js) - so it lands, stacks
// its rounds on a recast and runs out exactly as Detect or Light do. It is in the Spell Maker's list and, online,
// sold ready-made at the spell shop (worldModes `sharedCartographySpell`).
//
// THE SHARE. While the buff is live and its caster stands in a dungeon with a party, the automap rows THEY reveal
// (automap.js: the live record's visitedThisRun - the caster's own scan, never a mate's rows, so nothing echoes) go to
// the hub in batches - the new rows since the last send, at most AMAP_KEYS_MAX a frame, one frame every AMAP_SEND_MS
// at most (net/wire.js) - and the hub fans them to the party alone. A mate in the SAME dungeon marks them revealed
// and nothing else (automap.js mergePartyAutomap): they draw greyed, known but not walked. With the buff down nothing
// is sent (the rows wait - a recast sends what the caster mapped since this entry); outside a dungeon the sender
// forgets what it sent, so the next dungeon (or the same one entered again) starts whole.
//
// OFFLINE / SOLO: the buff lands and does nothing - there is no party to send to, and nothing else reads it.
