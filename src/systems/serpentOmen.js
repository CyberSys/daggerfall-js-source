// SERPENT1 (2026-10-04, Mac: "a large scale sea serpent in the ocean"): THE SIGHTING - what the clock's serpent says to
// one player: the chat's lines, the map's ring, the compass's mark. The gate's omen's twin (systems/gateOmen.js).
// Design: bible/11-Multiplayer/Sea-Serpent.md section 2.
//
// ONE CALL A FRAME from the online frame (scenes/world.js), reads for the maps and the HUD. Everything is a function of
// the RELAY'S clock (`now` - the welcome's offset); before the host is ready (the relay's clock heard, the hub's
// welcome come - a kill said at the hello lands then) nothing is said, and for SERPENT_OMEN_SETTLE_MS after it.
//
// EACH LINE IS SAID ONCE, by the serpent's day and how far through its lines: a player who sails in mid-fight hears the
// one line for where it stands now (gateOmen.js AUDIT WB C4's law - a clock that steps back never says one twice).
// The kill's line is the HUB's word (the link's onFell, which names the place from this machine's own site); a serpent
// slain says no sounding.
//
// THE SITE IS ASKED LAZILY: the lanes' walk (systems/serpentSite.js) runs the first time a serpent is in its omen or
// later - SERPENT2: or online, from its quiet on (`ahead`, the site said to the hub for its Discord herald) - and a
// host with no map data hands `site` a null and the omen stays silent rather than naming nowhere - asking again every
// SITE_RETRY_MS (a site that throws is none), so a map loaded late still names it that day.
//
// Not a DFU member. Ledger A (SERPENT1).
