// WILD-ROAD (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-04e, Discord - Private Joker, "Wilderness Encounter Chances": "having to completely halt
// my travel because 1 rat chose today to die can be quite the interruption ... If I'm going to be stopped on the road,
// let it be for something important or dangerous. a roving orc patrol, a bandit holdup, interrupting a necromancer
// party. This shouldn't be every encounter of course. A level 1 leaving privateers hold can take care of the rat
// problems"). DFU's lone wanderer (PlayerEntity.IntermittentEnemySpawn, systems/encounters.js chooseRandomEnemy - the
// verbatim band [L-3, L+3] four rolls in five, [0, L+1] or [0, 19] the fifth) keeps the bottom of its table in reach
// at every level, and a journey (Travel Options) or the Overworld stops for every wanderer it meets (AUDIT OW5b E1,
// journeyMet) - so a level 20 traveller was pulled off the road by a rat.
//
// ON THE ROAD - a Travel Options journey running, or the Overworld's raised view up - with the switch on (systems/
// features.js 'road-encounters', on by default; off is DFU's wanderer, unchanged):
//   - a TRIVIAL wanderer is passed by: a monster whose own level (ENEMY_BASICS) is at most a third of the traveller's
//     (TRIVIAL_LEVEL_RATIO) - a Rat from level 3, a Giant Bat from 9, an Orc from 15. The minute passes, nothing stands
//     and nothing stops. A class foe (id 128 and up) is built at the traveller's own level and is never trivial; a
//     solitary terror (a Lich, a Giant) never is either.
//   - the rest come in COMPANY now and then, a patrol of their own kind: from level 5, a chance of level/50 (at most
//     two in five) of one more, then one more each six levels past five (ROAD_COMPANY_MAX at most) - an orc patrol, a
//     brigands' holdup. Never a solitary kind (mobileFactions.js SOLITARY_TYPES - the PSCALE1 law), and never past
//     ROAD_PARTY_MAX with the party's own extras (partyScale.js).
// Off the road nothing changes. Pure. Not a DFU member - Ledger A (WILD-ROAD).
