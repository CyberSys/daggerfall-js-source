// REVENANT-CARD (2026-10-02): THE FACE A REVENANT SPEAKS THROUGH. systems/revenant.js builds each thing a revenant says or
// does as an EVENT (its portrait, its name, its words, and the one `line` a text surface says instead); a face
// registers here to draw them - ui/revenantCard.js, the enhanced skin's card - and answers whether it did. With none, or
// one that declines (the classic skin, a page without a document), the host's own `say` speaks the line. A LEAF: it
// imports nothing, so the HUD's card asks it without the revenant law's imports.
