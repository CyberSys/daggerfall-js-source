// WIND3 (2026-09-14, Mac: "wind audio without being too loud or
// overbearing") - THE WIND, HEARD.
//
// Daggerfall's exterior ambience has no wind: WeatherManager.
// SetAmbientEffects picks rain, storm, a sunny day or a clear night
// (systems/ambientEffects.js presetForExterior), and the wind clips in
// DAGGER.SND - AmbientWindMoan, AmbientWindMoanDeep, AmbientWindBlow1
// /1a/1b - are drawn only as DUNGEON one-shots (AMBIENT_SOUNDS.dungeon).
// The port's wind is its own thing (WIND1) and this gives it a voice:
// ONE loop whose gain follows the wind's STRENGTH and breathes with its
// GUSTS, and whose pitch rises a little as the wind gets up. The ceiling
// is WIND_GAIN_MAX, a murmur under the rain loop and the birds - Mac's
// "not too loud" is a number here, pinned - and the gain is slew-limited
// so a front's rise is a rise and a gust never pops.
//
// FIELD-WIND1 (2026-09-29, the Discord through Mac: "A repetitive moaning
// sound in the open world"): THE VOICE IS A BED, NOT A CLIP. WIND3 gave
// the loop those DAGGER.SND clips on the riding loop's shape (audio.
// setLoop: a clip played from its start again each time it ends) - the
// moan under 0.62 of the strength, the blow above. They are DFU's
// dungeon ONE-SHOTS, one every 5 to 28 seconds: short, shaped and
// pitched. AmbientWindMoan is 1.96 s that swells from nothing and falls
// back, a pitch in every fifth of a second of it, wandering from 100 to
// 613 Hz (autocorrelation 0.53 to 0.78 - a voice); AmbientWindBlow1 is a
// 5 s whistle, most of it at 550 to 613 Hz.
// Played end to end, the moan came back every 1.97 s under every breeze
// (measured live at Daggerfall: 45 starts in two minutes) - the moaning
// the players heard. WIND3 was written with no ARENA2 to hear it. There
// is no continuous wind in Daggerfall's data to loop, so the port makes
// one: white noise shaped into a soft whoosh (a band-pass under a
// low-pass), PERIODIC so the engine's native loop (audio.loop, the rain's
// door) has no seam, and levelled to the moan clip's own RMS so the gain
// law and its ceiling mean what they meant. The gusts are the gain's -
// nothing in the bed swells or repeats.
//
// It is NOT AmbientEffects: that module is DFU's AmbientEffectsPlayer
// bug for bug (its indoor carry-over included, AUDIT 26) and stays so.
// The hosts tick this beside it on the exterior frame and STOP it on
// every modal frame (inside a building or a dungeon), as they stop the
// mills' hum - the port's own sounds fall silent indoors. ENHANCED ONLY,
// behind its own row (`wind-sound` on the Features home, the pref
// `windSound`, the player's own online - ES1 folded it into the
// `enhanced-sounds` row, pref `soundEnhancements`); `?windaudio=off` the kill door.
