// REVENANT-VOICE (2026-10-02, Mac: "They should have their own unique personalities that affect their speach. One could
// be humorous, or witty, etc") - WHO A REVENANT IS, AND HOW IT TALKS. A leaf: the words and the pick, nothing else.
//
//  - TEN PERSONALITIES, one per revenant, drawn once from its id (so one revenant is always the same one, across a
//    save, a reload and every client that hears its name) and weighted by what it is: an orc leans brutal, a lich cold,
//    a daedra arrogant, a person anything at all.
//  - EVERY MOMENT IT HAS A WORD FOR, in that voice: its returns (by its last deed - it killed you, it ran from you, it
//    has risen three times), its flight, its cornering, its escape, its death, its gloat, its YIELD when beaten, its
//    last words under an execution, its oath when spared, its slip when you hesitate - and, sworn to you as a
//    companion, its arrival through a portal, its leaving, a fall, a kill, a fight and its farewell when released.
//  - A BEAST NEVER SPEAKS: the narrator says what it does, in its temperament ("with a nervous whine").
//
// `{p}` is the player's first name.
