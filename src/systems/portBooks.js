// classic table never had, written into the BOK format's own bytes (formats/bookFile.js) so the reader, the raum-book
// face, the item's title and its price read them as they read a classic book. The classic table baked from DFU
// (systems/booksData.js) is never touched: a port book's id is above every classic one, its low byte no classic
// book's (the filename law reads the low byte - BOK%05d.TXT), and the one door (ui/bookDoor.js) reads it here before
// it asks for a file. Design: bible/11-Multiplayer/World-Bosses.md section 19 C; the text is its appendix.

While a Septim wears the Amulet of Kings and the Dragonfires burn in the Temple of the One, no Prince of Oblivion may force his way into Tamriel. Our Emperor Uriel, seventh of that name, sits the Ruby Throne, and the fires burn. No invasion comes. But the Covenant was made to bar a door forced from without. It was never made to bar a door opened from within. Every apprentice who calls a scamp into a circle proves as much, and every coven of the Bay that calls a Prince on his own day proves it more loudly.'),
    section('The faithful', 'Mehrunes Dagon, Prince of Destruction, has never lacked for worshippers in a land as quarrelsome as ours. His faithful keep to the wilds, and to a rite older than Wayrest. They gather about a ring of braziers, burn his sigil into the earth, and bleed for him. What opens is not a gate as the Daedra raise them in their own realms. It is a breach: a wound in the world, held open by the will of the Prince and the blood of his faithful, and by nothing else.'),

He sends a lord of his house to hold it, a Dremora of the rank they call valkynaz, and the one who answers most often in our Bay names himself Ruhn. Among the faithful he is the Warden of the Burning Gate. I have spoken with three who stood before him and lived. They agree that he is very large, that he burns, and that he does not tire.'),
    section('Why the doors close', 'Here the Covenant shows its teeth. A breach is a door the Dragonfires did not permit, and they will not suffer it long. From the hour it opens the Covenant presses upon it like a hand upon a wound. Within two hours it is sealed; two hours after, it collapses entirely, and whatever of Dagon\'s remains on our side is cast back into the Deadlands. Should the Warden fall before then, the breach fails at once. It is his will that holds the door.'),
    section('The Battlespire', 'I am asked whether the Prince has done such a thing before. He has, and worse. In the years of the false Emperor his legions took the Battlespire itself, where the Empire trained its battlemages, and held it until a single apprentice drove them out. Not since the Battlespire fell has Dagon found doors so wide as these.'),
    section('The embers', 'Those who close a breach carry out coals of its fire. They do not cool and they do not go out, and in the Guild we call them Deadlands embers. The Guild will buy them for study. A certain Broker of the wilds pays better, and asks fewer questions.'),
    section('Counsel', 'If you would close a door, find the faithful first. Their circle stands within sight of where the breach will open, and their smoke rises with the first omen. No one coven opens a breach - the Prince presses on that place from his side, and the faithful only widen the wound - so their door will open whatever you do. But cut down their Summoner before the rite is done, and the fire of the broken rite clings to those who broke it: when the door is closed, it pays each of them an ember more. What the faithful keep in their circle is yours as well. Do not go alone. Do not stand where the ground glows. And when the Covenant closes the door, do not be on the wrong side of it.'),
