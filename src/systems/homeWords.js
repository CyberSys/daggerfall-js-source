// HOME-PRICE (AUDIT HOME-PRICE E4/C4, 2026-10-04) — HOW A HOME'S GOLD IS SAID.
//
// The sums a home's lines say, and the account they say its gold moves in -
// one spelling for the door, the rent, the decorator and the arena's letter,
// so one door never says "45,000 gold ... your account at the Bank of the
// Empire" beside "10000 gold a day ... this region's bank account". Pure, and
// imports nothing: systems/onlineHomes.js, systems/homeRent.js,
// systems/arenaText.js and scenes/decorTool.js all read it, and onlineHomes
// already imports homeRent and arenaText.
