// WA1 (2026-09-25, Mac: "All mods attached are to be compatible and
// implemented 1:1") - WARM ASHES - SHIPS 1.1 (Kamer): "Encounters on Ships
// and Ocean Fast Travel". The mod's code, ported off its IL
// (vendor/warm-ashes-ships/il/Warm_Ashes_Ships.il.txt; the ILSpy reading
// agrees line for line):
//
//   OnPreFastTravel [IL_03dc]  a journey that crosses the sea: three times
//     in four nothing (Random.Range(0, 100) < 75), and nothing while a
//     borrowed ship is out; else, sailing - the ambush is armed, a player
//     without a ship is LENT the large one, and both ship blocks take the
//     `_smallraid` world-data variant (the pirate vessels standing off);
//     not sailing - both take `_base`.
//   CheckforEncounters [IL_0384], OnPostFastTravel - an armed ambush waits
//     WaitForSeconds(0.05) on the mod's MonoBehaviour, then
//   TransportToShipWithDelay [IL_05e0]  starts WAQ_SHIP_SMALLRAID and puts
//     the player on the ship (TransportMode = Ship - a board, remembered
//     from the arrival); a lent ship is taken back at once (ResetShip -
//     you stand on a deck you do not own).
//   LeaveShip [IL_0540]  the quest's "Leave Ship": in region 31 (the sea,
//     PlayerGPS's politic 64) the blocks go back to `_base` and the player
//     is put ashore where they boarded - a lent ship is lent again just
//     long enough to leave it, then gone for good; anywhere else, nothing.
//
// The state is the mod's own save record, `WarmAshesShipsSaveData`
// (TempShip, HasTraveledbyShip), riding DFU's per-mod slot
// (systems/modSaveData.js). The world host (scenes/world.js) is the only
// host with a travel map, a ship or a quest machine for them, so it is the
// one that registers the seams below.
//
// `OnCreateLocationGameObject` [IL_04e3] / `HandleLocationWithDelay` [IL_06a0] wait
// half a second and log the location's name - a Debug.Log and nothing
// else, so nothing here.
