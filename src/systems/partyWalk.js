// TV8 - GROUP TRAVEL, THE LEADER DRIVES (bible/06-Systems/Travel-View.md, THE OVERHAUL).
//
// Mac (2026-09-28): "Group traveling is possible? Where the leader dictates on the map where to go?" - his call, "Leader
// drives". A party leader's Overworld journey (a place, or a spot) is offered to the members gathered with them; a
// member who says yes walks the same journey beside them, in their own Overworld. A stop for one is a stop for all.
//
// THE WIRE (net/wire.js validPartyPose, world123): the leader's pose carries the WALK `tw` - the destination pixel `x`,
// `y` (and a spot's own point `sx`, `sz` in native units), the round's stamp `at`, the moment the party (re)set out
// `go`, and the moment it HALTED `h` (null while it walks); a member's pose carries `ts`, the moment their own journey
// stopped for a reason of theirs (a foe, a band, a window) - the leader halts on a member's stop newer than the last
// go, and the halt reaches everyone. Every stamp is the shared clock's (the hub's `now`), so every client orders them
// alike. AUDIT OW3 P10: a member's yes or no is LOCAL - it rides nothing (PARTY-TRAVEL's `tr`/`td` are its own round's,
// never this one's); the leader hears of a member's walk only through that member's `ts`.
//
// PURE: the leader's step and a member's, off the poses and what this client's journey did; the host (scenes/world.js
// partyWalkFrame) does the prompting and the journeys. AUDIT OW3 P11: every decision the host used to make inline lives
// here now, so the halt/resume cycle, a stale yes, an arrival told from a stop, the pose's grace and the resume to the
// same place are proved by running them, not by the shape of the host's lines.
// AUDIT OW4 (2026-09-28, the second pass): a spot re-aimed while it walks sets out (P1); a halt lapses (P2); a journey that
// cannot run is not set out again by the party (P4); a member's own journey under a halt leaves the walk (P6). The host's
// half is run from its own source text (test/tv8_party_walk.test.js lifts partyWalkFrame - AUDIT OW4 P7).
