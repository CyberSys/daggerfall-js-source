// SEAT1d (2026-10-01, Mac: "Finish the seats"; "Continue") - A HELD SEAT
// AS THIS CLIENT LIVES IT (bible/11-Multiplayer/Seats-Arc.md 7.2, 7.3,
// 7.6): the seat town's shops priced for its holder's members and on
// Market Day; the town's news after its arrival line (Unrest, the Edict
// that rules); the Festive buff a Festival gives everyone who comes into
// the town; Curfew's stronger night watch and its doubled crime; the
// Bounty's camps - their loot doubled, each one cleared claimed.
//
// Every one of them is the player's own client acting on its own play -
// the members' discount is "their own gold, nothing to cheat but
// themselves" (7.2), and so is a Festival's buff or a Curfew's guard.
// What moves Drakes (the Bounty's twenty) is the service's, bounded there
// (seatHolding.js claimBounty). The seat a town is comes dressed from the
// seats' book (net/townSeatBook.js dressed: its holder, its Standing, the
// Edict that rules) - nothing here reads the service itself.
