// @ts-check
// ARENA-ARROWS (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-04e, systems/arenaQuiver.js): THE SHOTS A BOUT LOOSED, counted as they leave the bow.
// The quiver's mark alone read every arrow missing at the healers' heal as spent on the sand - so an arrow DROPPED in a
// bout (or sold, or given away) came back with the healers and the dropped stack still lay where it fell: a duplicate.
// Now the refund is the fewer of what is missing and what was loosed - the shots inventory.js spendAmmoFor took from
// the watched pack (a real round: a conjured one vanishes anyway), less every shaft lodged in a foe whose pack can be
// looted (combat/arrowFlight.js - a bout fighter's pack is thrown away with it, so a shaft in one is lost and pays).
// A leaf: no imports, so inventory.js and arrowFlight.js reach it with no cycle. Not a DFU member - Ledger A (ARENA-ARROWS).
