// PROF9 (2026-10-02) - THE PAN, Cooking's act at the fire (bible/06-Systems/Professions-Arc.md 9.4: "The fire: take the pan
// off in its window (the Skillet's is wider)"). A dish is cooked in recipeLaw panCount pans in turn (three; a feast five),
// each set on the fire cold: its heat climbs from 0 (raw) to 1 (burnt) in PAN_ACT.burnS x a pace the fire draws for that
// pan, and the pan is DONE while its heat stands in the window (recipeLaw panWindow - the rank's, the band's, and C&C's
// Skillet half again). The press takes the pan off: in the window it is done; before it raw. A pan left to burn is taken
// off burnt by the fire itself and the next goes on. Every pan done is a clean act. Pure - a machine the fire's section
// of the Stores page ticks and presses (ui/profPages.js), as the chisel is the mason's bench's (systems/chiselAct.js).
//
// The act is the client's, so it may be lied about: its report moves the service by its bounded step only (5.1's honest
// bound - a dish takes no quality, so a clean pan is half again its Cooking XP; the service reads `clean` and nothing
// else). Gentle acts cook plain: no window is shown, every take counts, none is done, and no act is clean.
