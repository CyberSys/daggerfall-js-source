// SHIP-WATCH (2026-10-01, Mac: "Do #3" - life aboard between fights: "crew sleep below at night, and a lookout up the
// mast calls 'Sail ho!'. The crew swab decks, haul lines and patch damage after a fight"; "If not already, ships at
// night should use their lanterns (AI)"; "I also want to keep improving the AI") - THE SEA BY NIGHT AND THE WATCH
// KEPT. The port's own; pure - the hour, the ships about and their lanterns in, the laws out.
//
// THE WATCH. From SLEEP_FROM_HOUR to SLEEP_TO_HOUR a crew sleeps below but its watch (`watchCount`, a third of them,
// one at least): the helmsman at his wheel, the lookout at the bow, and the first of the rest by the roster's order.
// The guns, a muster or her colours struck call every hand up at once (crewLife.js).
//
// THE LANTERNS BY NIGHT. A ship lights her lanterns at the city lights' hour (DaggerfallLight's, as Come Sail Away's
// boats do) - but not every ship: `runsDark` - a pirate prowls with hers out, and a merchantman running from a threat
// douses hers. A lit ship is seen far across the water; a dark one only close (`nightSight`): every captain's lookout
// (navalAI.js), and the player's own. Past LAMP_NEAR_M a lit ship's lanterns are drawn as points
// of light (`lampSize`, `lampAlpha`) - her own lantern flats are a pixel at that range and the light list holds the
// nearest eight, so the sea at night showed nothing of a ship but her black hull against the black water.
//
// THE LOOKOUT. AUDIT NAV1's SAIL HO! (navalHost.js hailSails) is cried by my crew's lookout at the bow now (crewLife.js
// `ctx.call`), and by night only as far as he can see her (`nightSight`): a pirate running dark is hailed close aboard.
