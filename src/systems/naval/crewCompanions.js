// refactor?") - THE PARTY ASHORE, pure. Which of the player's named hands (shipCrew.js) walk with the player, which
// rest aboard after a knock, and what each carries between places (his health). The host (scenes/navalHost.js) keeps
// one and saves it beside the crews; the world's companion layer (scenes/crewAshore.js) stands the party in whatever
// place the player is - the street, a building, a dungeon - and hands every change back here. DECLARED - Daggerfall
// has no followers, and Come Sail Away's crew never leaves the boat.
//
//  - UP TO COMPANION_MAX ashore at once, taken from a boat of mine's crewed roster by name (a name is the hand's for
//    life - shipCrew.js handName) - never one resting, never one already ashore.
//  - KNOCKED OUT, NEVER KILLED. A companion's health run out, he is carried back aboard (`knock`) and rests REST_MIN
//    of the world's minutes before he will come ashore again; his crew's spirits take KNOCKED_MORALE (shipCrew.js
//    MORALE_EVENT.knocked).
//  - A HAND THAT FALLS (the roster shorter, the boat gone) leaves the party and the rest with him (`prune`).

//    the last.

//    list the storage window takes from and stows into), saved with the party through the host's item codec; sent back
//    aboard, knocked out or fallen, he gives it up (`takePack`) and the host stows it in her hold.
