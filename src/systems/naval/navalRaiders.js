// NAV-R (2026-09-28, Mac, of main's Overworld raiders: "Definitely want them to appear as ships") - WARM ASHES'
// RAIDERS, STOOD AS SHIPS OF THE SEA. Main's OWS3 sails one raider a cell a life on the Overworld (systems/seaRaiders.js:
// seeded, so every player sees the same sail at the same minute) and drew none in play - alongside, the mod's raid
// boarded a ship the player was carried onto. Here a raider near a player at sea IS a pirate of the sea: its seed's own
// class and name, sailing its seeded course (steered for where that course is RAIDER_LEAD_S on, so the sail on the map is
// the sail met on the water) until its lookout (seaRaiders.js raiderSight: a day's 1,000 m, a night's 500) sights a
// boat - then a captain like any pirate's (systems/naval/navalAI.js): the broadsides, the grapple, and Warm Ashes' own
// raid on the boarded deck (WAQ_SHIP_SMALLRAID, scenes/navalHost.js beginFight). Sunk, taken, struck or given the slip,
// it is SPENT for its life - OWS3's own law, so the map does not raise it again.
//
// ONE COPY. A raider is stood by the client it is near - the chased traveller's own, as OWS3's chase was - and said in
// that client's word (NAV-G) like any ship it stands. AUDIT NAV1 (online): her seed is who she is in every client's sea,
// so a peer's copy of it is the handover's claim rule's (scenes/navalHost.js claimBeats - a taken-over copy holds her,
// else the lower id, TV7b's chaseYields law for a band two players chase): the weaker copy yields into the stronger's
// puppet, the same hull, and none is stood beside a copy already in my sea. THE MERGE with main's OW6 (its raider
// chases said on the cell's foes frames): a raider a peer HOLDS - their Overworld chase of it, or their sea's ship, each
// said in the raider word the world host hears (scenes/world.js seaRaidHear, seaRaidHeld) - is never stood here, OW6's
// own law ("never a sail a peer's chase holds"), and one stood here yields to a holder with the lower id - never from
// under a boarding.
//
// PURE: which raiders stand and which go, their class, and the course they steer; the host builds and steps them.
