// SEA-LANES (2026-10-02, Mac: "ships should be more persistant and actively engage with multiple docks and multiple
// pathways around daggerfall") - THE BAY'S PACKETS. The sea's traffic was the director's alone: ships stood on a ring
// about the player, crossing their waters on a slant, going about an errand only to a harbour the player had stood by,
// and let go out of sight for good - a ship seen leaving a port was never the ship met at the next, and none was ever
// on her way between two. The packets are ships of the Bay itself, between its ports:
//
// THE LANES. Every port town (Travel Options' 378, the map's harbours) with sea beside it - its ROADSTEAD, the nearest
// map pixel of open water within ROADSTEAD_PX of the town - runs packets to its LANE_NEIGHBOURS nearest such ports
// within LANE_MAX_PX: so every port has two lanes at least and most have three or four, and a coast is a chain of them,
// a headland's ports each other's neighbours across the water, the three crowns' capitals linked through the lanes'
// ports between them. A lane's way is the water's: an A* over the map's water pixels from one roadstead to the other,
// straightened wherever a line holds to the water (LANE_STRAIGHT_STEPS of it each pixel), no longer than LANE_PATH_PX.
//
// THE PACKET. One ship a lane, of the lane's own seed (the two ports'): a merchantman, or on LANE_NAVY of the lanes a
// crown's ship keeping the passage. She sails it out and back for ever on the SHARED CLOCK - out at her class's cruise
// (LANE_CRUISE of her best way), LANE_DWELL_S at the far port, home, LANE_DWELL_S at hers - from a phase of her seed, so
// where she is now is a function of the clock alone (OWS3's raiders' law): every player sees her in the same water at
// the same minute, a port left and come back to finds her further on, and a ship watched out of one port is the one that
// berths at the next. Her VOYAGE is her cycle: one sunk or taken is spent for it, and the lane's next cycle sails
// another (a company's next ship).
//
// PURE: numbers in, packets out. Places are map pixels (x east, y south from the map's top) and native world units
// (32768 a pixel, z north: (499 - y) pixels - streamingWorld.js mapPixelToWorldCoords, seaRaiders.js's own).
