// NAV-D (2026-09-28) - THE LAW AT SEA: what the crowns of the Bay make of a captain. The port's own, on DFU's own
// machinery - Daggerfall already names the crime (CRIMES.Piracy, 10, in the court's tables since the classic game),
// and its legal reputation and factions are the ledger. Pure: the host applies what this answers.
//
// THE WATERS ARE A CROWN'S. At sea DFU's region is 31 - "High Rock sea coast", a region with no town, no court and
// no people - so a crime there would be written in a ledger nobody reads. The port charges it to the crown whose
// waters these are (navalShips.js crownOf: the nearest of Daggerfall, Wayrest and Sentinel), each its own region.
//
// PIRACY. The first shot a player's guns land on a LAWFUL ship (a merchantman, a crown's navy) is Piracy against
// that ship's crown: DFU's own lowerRepForCrime (legal reputation by the crime's REPUTATION_LOSS_PER_CRIME, the
// region's people by half) - once per ship, however many shots follow - and NOTORIETY in that crown's waters
// (NOTORIETY.fire). Sinking her adds NOTORIETY.sink; taking her by boarding NOTORIETY.board and a second charge of
// the crime. A navy ship that SAW it (within WITNESS_RANGE of the lawful ship struck) is provoked at once.
//
// NOTORIETY is Black Flag's wanted level on Daggerfall's legal ledger: 0 to 100 in each crown's waters, falling
// NOTORIETY.decayPerDay each game day. From NAVY_HUNTS (navalAI.js) that crown's navy fights the player on sight,
// and from HUNTER_AT (navalDirector.js) it sends hunters. The HUD shows it as four anchors (`notorietyLevel`).
//
// A PIRATE'S END IS REWARDED as Warm Ashes rewards it (WAQ_SHIP_ATTACK_PIRATE's `_killcommanderknights_`: legal
// repute +3, the knightly order +3, the temple +1) - scaled to the pirate: a sloop's end is `PIRATE_REWARD.sunk`, a
// flagship's the quest's own numbers.
