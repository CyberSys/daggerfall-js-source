// @ts-check
// NAV-A (2026-09-28, Mac: "enhance the newly integrated ships by adding proper naval combat with a huge reference to
// assassins creed black flag. Being able to aim and fire when viewing from the side.") - THE BALLISTICS: where a
// round shot goes, and what it meets. The port's own (DFU has no cannon); pure, so the aim, the flight and the
// pins all read the one law.
//
// A SHOT IS A POINT UNDER GRAVITY ALONE. No drag, so its whole flight is a closed form of its launch -
//
//     p(t) = p0 + v0 t + g t^2 / 2        (g = -SHOT_GRAVITY along up)
//
// - and that one form is the arc the aim draws on the water, the path the ball flies, and the path every other
// client in a room flies from the same launch: a volley travels as its launches and each receiver draws the same
// balls, while the shooter alone resolves what they hit (NAV-G). Nothing integrates it step by step, so no frame
// rate bends a shot and a slow frame cannot tunnel one through a hull: the flight is swept as a segment from where
// the ball stood last frame to where the form puts it now.
//
// A GUN IS LAID, NOT POINTED. A broadside fires square to the hull - the ship is the traverse, as Black Flag's is -
// and the player sets only the range: where the look meets the sea is where the volley should fall, and
// `elevationForRange` finds the low arc that lands there, clamped to what the carriage allows. A ball leaves a
// moving deck at the deck's own speed as well (`launchVelocity`'s carry), so the zone the aim draws is where the
// balls really come down.
//
// DISPERSION IS SEEDED. `volleyRandom(seed)` is the one draw a volley's scatter reads, so the shooter and every
// receiver scatter one volley the same way; `scatter` bends a lay by up to its spread in each axis, the sum of two
// uniform draws (a triangular spread: most shots near the lay, a few at its edge).
