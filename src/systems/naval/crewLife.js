// @ts-check
// LIVING CREW (2026-09-29, Mac: "Crew members shouldnt be the static sprites and instead the enemy type sprites with
// multiple animations, they should navigate the deck, talk with each other, blurb, sing chantys, etc") - ONE SHIP'S
// CREW AT THEIR WORK: who stands on her deck, where each walks, who talks to whom, the lines over their heads and the
// chanty they sing, and - her guns out or a boarding at hand - the rail they muster at. Stepped by its host
// (scenes/navalCrew.js draws them) on her deck (navalDeck.js), in her deck's frame. Pure: a draw seeded by the ship
// (her `seed` - a player's boat by whose and which, AUDIT NAV2 F9), so every player in a room sees the same crew at the
// same kind of work, and no world.
//
// WHO THEY ARE. A ship of the sea's crew is her muster (navalBoarding.js musterOf, by what her crew has left): her
// captain and her men, the first CREW_SHOWN of them standing - and in a boarding the ones standing are the ones who
// fight, where they stand (scenes/navalHost.js takes them). A crewed boat of a player's is a hand's mix (PLAYER_CREW,
// a Bard among them to lead the song), CREW_PER_HAND of her crew a man.
//
// WHERE THEY STAND. The mod's own people flats are where a hull's crew stood (their places at rest, handed in as
// `places`): one on her walkable deck starts a walker there; one off it (the helmsman at her wheel on the poop) is a
// STATION - a man who stays at his post, turning and talking but never walking off it. The rest start spread across
// her deck (`deck.spots`).
//
// SHIP-WATCH (2026-10-01, Mac: "Do #3" - life aboard between fights; shipWatch.js): BY NIGHT (`ctx.asleep`) her crew
// turns in but its watch (shipWatch.js watchCount - her stations, her lookout, then the roster's first): the rest walk
// to her HATCH (her main deck's middle) and go below, off her deck but still hers (`below` - never `gone`: the count
// stands whole and the guns' trim and the mending's restore read them as they were) - at once, never a walk, when she
// first stands by night; the guns, a muster or her colours struck call every hand up at once ("All hands on deck!"),
// and the morning one at a time out of her hatch - never two on one point; a repair order keeps every hand at the work.
// HER LOOKOUT (one walker - never her Bard, nor her captain at his post; her card's Lookout when he can, `ctx.lookout`)
// keeps the bow from the moment she stands, another the moment he is gone, facing out and talking to nobody, and the
// host gives him the calls (`ctx.call`: "Sail ho! Off the starboard bow!"). AT WORK (`ctx.work`, 0..1 - what a fight
// left to mend): an idle man takes up a job at a free spot more often the more there is, swinging at it (his sprite's
// attack, `swing`) - the night watch too - and now and then a chore at peace and by day (CHORE_SHARE), swabbing and
// hauling; the guns or her colours end it.
