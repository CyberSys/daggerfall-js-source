// NAV-D (2026-09-28, Mac: "actual sailing ships to the world that players can encounter and pillage, which should
// also directly enhance and integrate into the pirate quest system") - BOARDING: taking a ship with the sword, and
// throwing boarders off your own. The port's own; pure - the phases, the berth, the musters and the reckoning. The
// host stands the foes, moves the player, opens the windows and runs the quests.
//
// WHEN YOU BOARD HER. A ship that has struck her colours (navalDamage.js STRUCK_AT) lies within BOARD_RANGE of your
// helm, your way under BOARD_SPEED: Activate (the key the prompt names) throws the grapples. She is hauled
// ALONGSIDE over GRAPPLE_S - swung parallel to your hull on the side she lies, BERTH_GAP of water between the two
// planks (`berthPose`) - and you go over her rail onto her deck. Her crew stands to fight on it: her MUSTER, what her
// class sends (navalShips.js `boarders`) thinned by what her crew has lost, never under MUSTER_MIN nor over
// MUSTER_MAX, led by her CAPTAIN - a pirate flagship's and a navy's a named officer, the Spellsword Warm Ashes makes
// the pirates' leader (WAQ_SHIP_ATTACK_PIRATE `_spells_`). A crewed ship of your own sends HANDS with you - Warm
// Ashes' crew, Warriors on the player's side (its `_ally_`), one for every CREW_PER_HAND of your crew, at most
// HANDS_MAX. Her captain dead and SURRENDER_SHARE of her muster with him - or every man of them - she is your PRIZE
// (navalPlunder.js). Swim or sail more than ABANDON_RANGE from her and the fight is given up: her men stand down
// and she lies struck.
//
// WHEN THEY BOARD YOU. A pirate that grapples (navalAI.js GRAPPLE_*) is hauled alongside the same way, and its men
// come over YOUR rail. A crewed ship of yours meets them with Warm Ashes' own raid - WAQ_SHIP_SMALLRAID, or from a
// pirate flagship WAQ_SHIP_ATTACK_PIRATE, the waves and the captain that quest was written for and the mod never
// started - on your own deck; a boat with no crew meets a party of the naval arc's own (REPEL_PARTY). Throw them off
// and their ship, her boarders spent, lies struck alongside: board her in turn.
