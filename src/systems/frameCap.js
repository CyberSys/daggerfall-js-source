// FPS-CAP1 (2026-09-25, Mac: "Add FPS limiter to settings") - THE FRAME
// RATE CAP. DFU's `Video/TargetFrameRate` had sat in the store since the
// settings screen shipped, labelled "Frame Rate Cap" and read by nothing.
// This is its consumer: StartGameBehaviour.ApplyStartSettings' two lines,
// `if (TargetFrameRate >= 30 && !VSync) Application.targetFrameRate =
// TargetFrameRate` (StartGameBehaviour.cs:244-250), with the setting read
// the way SettingsManager reads it, GetInt(0, 300) (SettingsManager.cs:414).
//
// ONE RECORDED DEPARTURE: THE CAP HOLDS UNDER VSYNC. Unity ignores
// targetFrameRate while vSyncCount is set, so DFU's rule turns the cap
// off whenever VSync is on. A browser has no other mode: every frame
// waits for the screen, and `Video/VSync` is unavailable here for that
// reason (systems/settings.js UNAVAILABLE). Read DFU's way, the cap
// could never do anything. So it holds frames BACK from the screen's
// rate, which is the only thing a page can do - it never runs faster.
// FPS-VSYNC (2026-09-28): EXCEPT IN THE DESKTOP APP WITH VSYNC OFF. The
// shell lifts Chromium's wait at launch (app/lib/frameRate.cjs), rAF
// then runs past the screen, and the cap is what holds the frames -
// DFU's targetFrameRate exactly, Off letting them run free - through
// THE PACER below, not this gate alone (AUDIT 28e).
//
// HOW A FRAME IS HELD. Each host's rAF callback asks `frameCapSkip(now)`
// before its clock stamp and its input frame (the pins in
// test/fpscap1.test.js say where). A held callback re-arms and returns:
// nothing is simulated or drawn, `last` does not move (so the next drawn
// frame's dt covers the held time), and the input rings keep gathering
// (beginInputFrame has not run), so no key press is lost. The decision
// is made ONCE per rAF stamp, because every callback of one browser
// frame is handed the same stamp - so the FPS counter (ui/fpsCounter.js),
// which runs on its own rAF, asks the same question and counts the
// frames the game drew, not the screen's refresh.

/**
 * THE PACER (FPS-VSYNC, AUDIT 28e: the frame lane measured it). With Chromium's frame-rate limit lifted, a rAF callback
 * that draws nothing costs a whole refresh: the display scheduler waits out the screen's deadline for a frame with no
 * damage (display_scheduler.cc: `if (!needs_draw_) return kLate`), and the back-to-back begin-frame source ticks again
 * only after a frame finishes - so an ask that comes after an idle tick waits that tick's refresh out too. So the gate
 * alone - a held callback re-arms and returns - held every cap UNDER the screen: 300 drew 56 a second on a 60 Hz one.
 * There, and only there, the page's rAF is paced instead: a request waits on a timer until just before its slot
 * (PACER_LEAD_MS) and is handed to the browser only then, and the frame that answers IS the slot (capTake) - so no
 * callback runs that does not draw. Every request of one slot rides one browser frame with one stamp, whoever made it
 * (a host, the counter, a menu's loop, a window's one-off), and the hosts' own question for that stamp reads the same
 * answer and draws. The cap Off hands every request straight through: DFU's VSync off with no target frame rate, as
 * fast as it goes. Measured in the app (Electron 42 under Xvfb, the frame lane's harness): 144, 240 and 300 draw 144,
 * 240 and 300. Pure over its seams, so the tests drive it on a clock of their own.
