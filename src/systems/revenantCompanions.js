// REVENANT-COMPANION (2026-10-02, Mac: "Spare should allow you to free the enemy, which then adds them as a companion,
// which you could keep send them away or keep them with you. Reuse the crew companion system. Companion slots should
// still be limited") - THE SWORN. A revenant the player spares is sworn to the player for good: it hunts nobody, and it
// walks at the player's side - or waits, sent away, until it is called.
//
//  - ONE LAYER: the crew's (scenes/crewAshore.js) stands them, places them, brings them along through every door, keeps
//    them to the player's heel, catches one up that falls behind, and carries their health and spells between places.
//    This file is that layer's PARTY for the sworn - the crew's own party shape (systems/naval/crewCompanions.js): who
//    walks ashore, a knock, a hurt - kept in the revenant's own record (systems/revenant.js `companion`), so it rides the
//    character's save and app storage with everything else the revenant is.
//  - THE PLAYER'S SIDE HAS SLOTS (systems/companionSlots.js COMPANION_SLOTS, the crew's hands ashore counted with
//    them). A spared one past them is sworn all the same and waits AWAY until there is room and the player calls it.
//  - AT MOST REVENANT_RETINUE_MAX sworn at once, with the player and away together; past it the player must release
//    one before sparing another.
//  - KNOCKED OUT it is carried off to rest, as a hand is carried aboard: REVENANT_REST_MIN of the character's minutes,
//    then it waits, fit again, to be called.
