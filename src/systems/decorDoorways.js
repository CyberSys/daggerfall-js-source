// HOME-DOORS (2026-09-30) — A DOOR HUNG IN A DOORWAY, AND WHERE ONE GOES.
//
// Asked: "For houses with multiple rooms attached, I want to add a door
// item that can attach to the wall that leads to another room. This
// needs to have an easy element where it tells you where you can place
// it."
//
// THE DOOR is one of Daggerfall's own: the five interior door models
// DaggerfallInterior hangs (world/interiorLayout.js DOOR_MODEL_BASE_ID,
// DOOR_MODEL_COUNT), read into the catalogue from the town blocks' own
// door records (systems/decorCatalogue.js), priced by size as any piece
// is. Placed, it stands as an ACTION DOOR (world/actionSystem.js addDoor,
// keyed `act:decor:<id>` - scenes/decorRoom.js hands it to the host): it
// swings open and shut, blocks while shut, is saved and is shared with
// whoever stands in the room, exactly as the room's own doors are. The
// account service keeps it as the piece it is (a model id, a place), so
// nothing on the service knows a door from a chair.
//
// WHERE ONE GOES: a DOORWAY - an opening in a wall between two floors
// the eye passes between (systems/decorRooms.js links: a doorway is
// exactly where the room finder saw the eye go through a wall). Each
// link is looked across at waist height: where the space either side of
// it narrows to a door's width for no deeper than a wall is thick, and
// opens out again on both sides, that narrowing is a doorway - its
// middle between the jambs, its floor, its lintel, the way through it.
// A corridor narrows for its whole length and is no doorway. A doorway a
// door already hangs in (one of the room's own, open, or one placed) is
// taken.
//
// THE EASY ELEMENT: while a door is being placed, every free doorway is
// marked (the tool's decal pass - decorDoorwayQuad) and the door is
// fitted, whole, into the one the eye looks at (decorDoorwayAimed,
// decorDoorFit: turned into the wall, sized to the opening, stood on its
// floor); a turn swings it the other way. Looking at none, the bar says
// how many are free, or that the house has none.
//
// STEPPED, as the room finder is. Pure: the collider's `raycastHit` is an
// argument. Not a DFU member: Daggerfall Unity has no decorator. Ledger A.
