// CROWN-HALL (2026-10-02, Mac: "Build that next" - the crown's hall
// after SEAT-HALL's palace): A CROWN'S CASTLE AS ITS HOLDER'S HALL
// (bible/11-Multiplayer/Seats-Arc.md 7.2: "Crown: the castle is the
// hall - its throne room carries the holder's banners, the roster board
// and the Stores chest, and no decor").
//
// THE THRONE ROOM is where the crown's ruler holds court: the region's
// Province faction's first child, when it is an Individual, IS the
// ruler (MacroHelper.GetLordNameForFaction's own law - talk.js
// lordNameForFaction), and the castle's static NPC carrying that
// faction id stands in the throne room (Gothryd, Eadwyre, Akorithi).
// DECIDED: the pieces are placed about that person, measured in the
// dungeon's own collider - no castle's layout is written down here.
//
//   - THE BANNERS: two, on the wall behind the ruler (the nearest
//     surface round the throne, over its back - the room opens the
//     other way), a pace and a half either side, the cloth's top under
//     the ceiling;
//   - THE ROSTER BOARD and THE STORES CHEST: Daggerfall's own board
//     model and chest model, standing on the floor a few paces into the
//     room, one either side of the aisle, each where a clear line runs
//     to it from the throne and the floor under it is the throne
//     room's.
//
// A castle where no such person stands, or where the collider finds no
// floor under them, stands none of it (said nowhere - the castle is as
// Daggerfall has it). Pure: the host hands the faction dict, the people
// and the collider's ray.
