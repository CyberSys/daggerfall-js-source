// @ts-check
// PROF4 (2026-09-28, Mac: "Continue") - THE PLANE, Carpentry's act at the workbench (bible/06-Systems/Professions-Arc.md
// 9.4, 25): "a steady drag along the grain, deviation scored as the trace is". The grain runs across a board, a gentle
// wave its own each act; the player presses at its head and draws the plane to its foot. Pure - a machine the
// workbench's page feeds pointer positions (ui/profPages.js), as the heat is the anvil's (systems/heatAct.js).
//
// Positions are the board's: `x` 0 (the head) to 1 (the foot), `y` a share of its half-height, up positive. A pass is
// clean when its mean deviation from the grain is within the tolerance (recipeLaw planeTolerance: the rank's, x the
// attribute band) and it took PLANE_ACT.minS to maxS - a plane is drawn, not flicked (AUDIT 30 A1: its clock starts
// when the plane first moves forward, not at the press, and a jump between two pointer events is measured along the
// line it drew, every PLANE_ACT.step - a press held still and one flick to the foot was a clean pass). A pass let go before the foot
// starts again. The act is the client's, so it may be lied about: its report moves the service's roll by one quality
// step at most (5.1's honest bound - the service reads `clean` and nothing else). Gentle acts plane plain.
