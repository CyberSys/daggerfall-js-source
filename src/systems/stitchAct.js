// PROF7 (2026-09-29, Mac: "Do it") - THE STITCH, Outfitting's act at the loom (bible/06-Systems/Professions-Arc.md 9.4,
// 29): "presses on a beat, eight in a row". The needle's beat comes every STITCH_ACT.beatS; a stitch pressed while the
// beat stands in the band (recipeLaw STITCH_ACT.bandW, centred on it, x the attribute band) is on the beat. Pure - a
// machine the loom's page ticks and presses (ui/profPages.js), as the heat is the anvil's (systems/heatAct.js).
//
// The act is the client's, so it may be lied about: its report moves the service's roll by one quality step at most
// (5.1's honest bound - the service reads `clean` and nothing else). Gentle acts stitch plain: every stitch counts, none
// is on the beat, and no act is clean.
