// @ts-check
// WB1 (2026-09-25): THE OMEN - what the clock's gate says to one player: the chat's lines, the map's ring, the
// compass's mark. Design: bible/11-Multiplayer/World-Bosses.md sections 1-2.
//
// ONE CALL A FRAME from the online frame (scenes/world.js `gateFrame`, beside the chat's and the duel's - before the
// dead return, so the omen still speaks to a player on the death screen), and reads for the maps and the HUD.
// Everything here is a function of the RELAY'S clock (`now`), which the host reads through the welcome's offset
// (WORLD5); before the first welcome the offset is 0 and the machine's own clock stands in, as it does for the sky.
//
// EACH LINE IS SAID ONCE. The last moment announced is remembered by the gate's day and phase, so a frame that finds
// the same phase says nothing, and a player who arrives mid-gate hears the one line for where the gate stands now -
// "it opens in 2:30", not the omen, the rise and the countdown in a burst - with what goes beside it once a day (the
// rite's order, tonight's marks; AUDIT WB12d D21).
//
// THE SITE IS ASKED LAZILY: the scan over the map files (systems/gateSite.js) runs the first time a gate is in the
// omen or later, not at boot, and a host with no map data (a probe, a test) hands `site` a null and the omen stays
// silent rather than naming nowhere.
//
// Not a DFU member. Ledger A (WB).

// Mac (2026-09-26): "Improve the sky effect to be more like the /event dread command" - "When I say sky effect, I mean
// daggerfall, not the inside". The omen has always SAID it - "The sky burns over the wilds near ..." - and the sky over
// the site never did: the gate's only mark on it was its beacon. Now the sky over a gate wears the live event's dread

// the event's red storm gathered round the gate - not round the eye - so its lightning shows where the gate stands.

// at the same moment; nothing is sent. The court (the inside) keeps the Deadlands' own sky (render/deadlands.js).

// ITS LIFE: the omen's first line kindles it (GATE_SKY_KINDLE of it within GATE_SKY_KINDLE_MS, so the line is true at
// once) and it deepens to GATE_SKY_OMEN by the rise, to GATE_SKY_RISEN by the opening, and whole within
// GATE_SKY_KINDLE_MS of it; open, sealed and until its end (the kill or the wrath) it burns whole; it clears as the gate
// collapses (GATE_COLLAPSE_MS) - the dread lifting as the event's does. Never a step: every stage walks from the last. ITS REACH: whole within GATE_SKY_FULL_M of the gate - the town it is reached from stands under it
