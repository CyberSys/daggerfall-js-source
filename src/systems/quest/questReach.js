// NEARBY-QUESTS (2026-10-04, Discord: "quests weren't made with this in mind and are randomized ... you can just get
// unlucky and have one sending you far away, screwing you heavily"; "quests of the game you take from guilds and so on
// need to be near you on overworld map"): WHERE A REMOTE QUEST SITE MAY STAND.
//
// DFU picks a remote site (Place.cs SelectRemoteTownSite / SelectRemoteDungeonSite / SelectRemoteLocationExteriorSite)
// uniformly over the player's whole REGION - a region runs to a hundred map pixels and more, a week's walk, and the
// port's harder road (camp encounters, the rest rules) made a level-one character's long trip a lost bedroll and no way
// home. With Nearby quests on, a site is drawn from the ones within the QUEST REACH of the player's map pixel, and the
// reach grows with level, so the early game stays close and by the mid-teens it covers a region (DFU's own draw).
//
// The distance is CHEBYSHEV - max(|dx|, |dy|) in map pixels - because the travel reckoning (systems/travel.js
// calculateTravelTime) walks the longest axis and charges a pixel per step: the reach is a travel time, not a crow's
// line. On foot, cautiously, a pixel is two to four hours by the climate, so ten pixels is a day or two.
//
// Nothing here draws a roll: the callers (systems/quest/place.js) draw from the pools this returns with the quest's
// own injectable roll, so a seeded quest stays seeded. Off, the callers never call in, and every draw is DFU's.
