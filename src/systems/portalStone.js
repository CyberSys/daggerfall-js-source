// PORTAL1 (2026-10-04, the owner: "So with the removal of fast travel, I want to implement a new item available at all
// shops, this should cost weykar shards (from dismantling gear with rarity). These should always be readily available.
// When using this item, it opens a portal allowing you to traverse to anywhere on the map. This is a one use item that
// stays open for a short time, allowing multiple players to traverse"): THE PORTAL STONE.
//
//   - THE STONE (systems/gateSpoils.js, template 572 beside the Welkynd Shard's 571): bound, stacking with its own kind.
//   - THE COUNTER: every shop's keeper (shopStock.js isShop - the nine kinds) sells one for PORTAL_STONE_SHARDS Welkynd
//     Shards, from a row on the keeper's own popup (ui/merchantServiceWindow.js, ui/merchantRepairWindow.js, and the
//     Enhanced Plus panel) - never from a shelf: a shelf is the gold trade's, and nothing here is gold. ALWAYS IN STOCK:
//     nothing is kept, so every sale mints a fresh stone.
//   - THE USE: the pack's Use (or a hotbar press) hands the stone to the host's `openPortal` door - the open world's
//     alone (scenes/world.js; a building, a dungeon and the standalone street say why not). The travel map opens in
//     teleport mode; a place picked there spends ONE stone and tears a portal open in front of the player
//     (portalPlace), for PORTAL_OPEN_MS (scenes/portalGates.js). A map closed without a pick spends nothing.
//   - THE PORTAL: anyone who WALKS INTO it - the opener, and online every player near it - arrives at the place the way
//     the Mages Guild's teleport arrives (world.js teleportTo: free, at once). Only a step from outside to inside is an
//     entry (portalStepIn), and the step is forgotten across any gap (scenes/portalGates.js): a portal that opens on
//     top of someone, or stands outside the door they come out of, takes nobody.
//   - THE HOLDS (portalHold): one ladder the door, the pick and the step all ask - a move under way, a duel, a siege's
//     wards, an enemy near, a journey - so a portal is never a way out of what the travel map refuses to leave.
//   - ONLINE: the opener's foes frame carries it (`pg`, portalWire) on every full frame while it stands and its opener
//     stands near it - the camps' and the duel ring's road, so the relay reads none of it and needs no new version. A
//     peer believes it only near its opener's own feet, keeps its own copy to the time first said (never longer), one
//     an opener, and names its destination off its own map; a pixel with no location refuses the record.
//
// Not a DFU member - Ledger A.
