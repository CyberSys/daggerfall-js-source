// REVENANT-HARM (2026-10-02): WHO LAST HARMED THE PLAYER, when no blow says it. A killing BLOW names its foe (the struck
// seam, systems/sigilSetPowers.js's landed blow); a spell's burn, a lingering effect's round and a poison's tick reach
// the player's hurt with nobody on them. So each leaves its foe here as it lands:
//   - a spell landing on the player (scenes/hostMagic.js applySpellToPlayer - a missile, a blast, a touch);
//   - a lingering effect's round (systems/effects.js runEffectRound - the caster the entry carries);
//   - any foe's blow that reaches the player (the struck seam) - a poisoned weapon's dose rides that blow, and its ticks
//     come later, so this mark lasts longest.
// systems/revenant.js reads it when a hurt with no blow takes the player's last health. A LEAF: it imports nothing.
