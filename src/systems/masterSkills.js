// SOFTCAP3 (2026-09-29): MASTER SKILLS - the climb past 100.
//
// A LEAF (it imports nothing), read by skills.js, advancement.js and the
// softcap's enemy law, so none of them grows a cycle.
//
// WHAT IT IS. With Master Skills in force:
//   - skills climb past 100 to 200 on the softcap's ladder (skillSoftcap.js),
//     learning there only from foes tough for the skill;
//   - Daggerfall's 95 lock is lifted (PlayerEntity.RaiseSkills'
//     AlreadyMasteredASkill gate: once a PRIMARY skill is mastered no other
//     skill at 95+ may rise), so every skill can reach 100 and go on;
//   - dangerous dungeons answer with tougher foes (skillSoftcap.js combatEdge).
// Below 100 nothing is different either way.
//
// WHO DECIDES (Mac, 2026-09-29: "no opt-in or opt-out ... only in offline
// mode there should be opt in and out"):
//   ONLINE  - always in force; nobody switches it. The first time a primary
//             skill is mastered, a box EXPLAINS it once, with an OK button.
//   OFFLINE - the player's switch (entity.masterSkills), off by default: the
//             first mastery ASKS once (Yes/No), and the skill screen keeps the
//             switch. Not inside a dungeon - its foes were scaled (or not) as
//             they spawned, so switching on under unscaled foes would be a free
//             lunch; the host's gate says so (setMasterSkillsGate).
//
// SPECIALISING (Mac, 2026-09-29: "lets do 2/2/1 - when a skill reaches 100 the player gets to choose ... this
// decision can not be undone"). Master Skills lets EVERY skill reach 100 (the 95 lock is lifted), but only the
// skills a character MASTERS may pass it: 2 of the 3 primary, 2 of the 3 major, 1 of the 6 minor - five in all
// (MASTERY_SLOTS). Miscellaneous skills never pass 100. The choice is offered the first quiet pass after a skill
// reaches 100 while its group has a slot (and any time after from the skill screen), says how many that group
// allows and how many remain, and is PERMANENT (entity.masteredSkills, saved). A skill not mastered simply stays at
// 100 - classic Daggerfall's ceiling - and teaches nothing more.
//
// NOTHING IS LOST. Off never lowers a stored value: a skill above 100 READS
// as 100 while off (the same overlay shape as mentor mode), and reads its
// real value again when on - offline switched back on, or the same character
// played online.
//
// THE BOXES. Made by scenes/shared.js raisePlayerSkills on a pass that put no
// other window up (no mastery box, no level-up sheet): the OK box online, the
// Yes/No box offline - each DFU's own message box on the classic skin (and so
// in any UI pack's art over it), the skin's card on the enhanced one.
