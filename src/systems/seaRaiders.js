// OWS3 - WARM ASHES' RAIDERS, SEEN COMING (bible/06-Systems/Travel-View.md,
// "OWS - the sea"). The player's ask: "The pirate quest system should work
// like how we're changing enemies and nearby dungeons. Like mount and
// blade, being able to see other players sailing in the overworld and
// other enemy ships".
//
// Warm Ashes - Ships' raid is a roll the traveller never sees: a sea
// crossing by fast travel, three in four in peace, and the ambush
// (systems/warmAshesShips.js). The Overworld's sea has its raiders as
// SHIPS instead: they sail its open water, and a sail that sights a
// traveller at sea gives chase; outsailed it gives up, and the one that
// closes makes the mod's own raid (WAQ_SHIP_SMALLRAID, the ship boarded).
//
// SHARED BY THEIR SEED, never sent: a cell of RAIDER_CELL_PX map pixels
// holds at most one raider a life (RAIDER_LIFE_MS of the shared clock),
// rolled from the cell and the life alone, and it wanders a course that
// is a function of its seed and the clock - so every player in the
// region sees the same sails in the same places at the same minute. A
// chase is the chased traveller's own (TV7's roaming bands' way, on the
// Overworld round's branch).
//
// PLACES ARE NATIVE WORLD UNITS (32768 a map pixel) and a pixel's row
// counts SOUTH from the map's top: z = (499 - row) x 32768 +, MapsFile's
// own two (formats/mapsFile.js mapPixelToWorldCoord / worldCoordToMapPixel)
// - the one law travellerMarks.js keeps too.
//
// PURE: numbers in, ships out.
