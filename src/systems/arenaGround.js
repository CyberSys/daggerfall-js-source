// CURSE-OFF-SAND (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-04e, Discord: "The ghosts outside are bothersome (I know they're story related)").
// The Curse of Daggerfall (S0000977, a world quest - scenes/questFoeHost.js WORLD_QUESTS) tries a wraith every 21
// minutes and a ghost every 31 from 19:00 to 05:00 while the player is in the city, each stood on a ring 5-20 m round
// them (CreateFoe's own placement). The hour's exhibitions run until 21:00 and a ladder bout at any hour, so the curse's
// dead came for the player at the gate, in the stands and between bouts - and indoors, on the floor's instance and in
// the undercroft. The arena's grounds are kept: within ARENA_GROUND_M of the colosseum's sand (the hosts' own
// ARENA_NEAR_M, where the hour's bout is stood for a player outside), and the arena's two made levels, a curse wave is
// KEPT OFF at CreateFoe's spawn event (quest/actions.js `world.foeKeptOff` - the hosts' quest world asks this): it passes
// as a hidden Foe's does, the interval spent and no wave pending, so the curse is not lifted - its next interval's wave
// comes once the player is off the grounds. (Not at placement: a wave left pending raises the encounter event every
// machine tick, and broke a rest there each tick.) Only the curse: any other quest's foes are placed as DFU places them.
// Pure. Not a DFU member - Ledger A (CURSE-OFF-SAND; the arena is the port's own, ARENA2).
