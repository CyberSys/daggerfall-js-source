// PROF11 (2026-10-01) - THE CHISEL, Masonry's act at the mason's bench (bible/06-Systems/Professions-Arc.md 9.4: "strikes
// on marked lines that the glint's rule moves"). The stone is scored with CHISEL_ACT.lines lines; one is MARKED at a time,
// for chiselMarkS (1.2 s, 2.0 s at Master, x the band) and then the mark moves to another line - and it moves after every
// strike too: the Pick-Axe's glint's rule (systems/mineAct.js), a line for a point. The chisel is set on a line (the
// pointer's press names one; the arrows move it; the digits name one) and a strike lands there: on the marked line it is
// true. A cut or a mix takes four strikes, a carving seven (recipeLaw chiselStrikes); every one true is a clean act. Pure
// - a machine the bench's page ticks and strikes (ui/profPages.js), as the heat is the anvil's (systems/heatAct.js).
//
// The act is the client's, so it may be lied about: its report moves the service by its bounded step only (5.1's honest
// bound - a carving's one quality step; a cut's or a mix's half again of its XP, the Stores keeping no quality - the
// service reads `clean` and nothing else). Gentle acts strike plain: no line is marked, every strike counts, none is true,
// and no act is clean.
