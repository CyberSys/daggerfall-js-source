// ARENA-ARROWS (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-04e, Discord: "Arrows are not refunded, which causes problems"): THE QUIVER COMES
// BACK FULL FROM THE SAND. A bout's healers put the fighter back as they found them - health, fatigue and magicka (the
// duel's own heal, bible/11-Multiplayer/Arena.md "2. The fights") - but nothing put back what the bow spent. An arrow
// that strikes a foe is lodged in its pack (combat/arrowFlight.js) and looted from the corpse in any other fight; a bout
// fighter is stood with no pack, never dies (the yield floor: no corpse, no loot) and is taken away at the verdict, and a
// player's opponent is a remote body - so every arrow loosed on the sand was gone for good, and a ladder emptied a
// quiver tier by tier. Now the player's ammunition is counted as they step into a bout (`markQuiver`) and what the
// bout LOOSED is handed back with the healers (`refundQuiver`): the fewer of what is missing and the shots the bout's
// tally counted (systems/shotTally.js) - so an arrow dropped, sold or given away on the sand is no shot, and never
// comes back while the dropped stack still lies there.
//
// Counted: the ammunition every ranged weapon spends (inventory.js spendAmmoFor - an Arrow, a Dwemer Pellet), REAL
// stacks only: a conjured arrow (isSummoned) is spent first and vanishes anyway, and a quest's is never loosed. Never
// more than went in: a stack grown on the sand hands nothing back. Handed back as inventory.js addItem stacks it. Pure:
// the lists in, the count handed back out. Not a DFU member - Ledger A (ARENA-ARROWS).
