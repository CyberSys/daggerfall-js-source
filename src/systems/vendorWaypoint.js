// you want to buy from"). One waypoint at a time: the trader's house - its town's map id, the building's key there, whose
// it is and the town's name. Setting it puts its own gold coin on both world maps (ui/vendorMapMark.js -
// apart from the map's one yellow mark, which stays the player's), the house is named on the town map (scenes/world.js townHomes), and the compass
// points at the town until the player stands in it. Cleared by hand, or on walking into the house.
//
// Pure state: no DOM, no network. The host reads it each frame.
