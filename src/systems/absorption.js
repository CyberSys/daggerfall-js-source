// S24: SPELL ABSORPTION (EntityEffectManager.TryAbsorption /
// TryCareerBasedAbsorption / GetEffectCastingCost, MIT, Daggerfall
// Workshop).
//
// spellAbsorptionFlags had ZERO consumers. The SORCERER ships
// absorb = Always AND NoRegenSpellPoints, and only the penalty was
// live - the class paid its whole cost and got nothing back, which is
// the exact inverse of the classic trade. U20b then made the same
// absorption purchasable at 8-14 difficulty points.
//
// The law, in DFU's own order:
//   - DESTRUCTION ONLY (:1171). DFU's comment says why: absorption is
//     tested against every incoming effect, so a benign self-heal
//     would otherwise be swallowed.
//   - the cost is computed AS IF THE TARGET CAST IT (:1177), not the
//     real caster - they agree for a self-cast anyway.
//   - the target must have ROOM: cost > (maxMagicka - magicka) refuses
//     (:1180-1184). An absorber at full magicka absorbs nothing.
//   - then the sources in order: the Spell Absorption EFFECT, the
//     CAREER flag, and a persistent absorb state.
