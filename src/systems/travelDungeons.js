// TV6 - THE DUNGEONS, DISCOVERED ON APPROACH (bible/06-Systems/Travel-View.md, THE OVERHAUL).
//
// Mac (2026-09-28): "Random encounters and nearby dungeons implemented should somehow be detailed implemented into the
// new overworld ... Like a true overhaul for the new overworld"; his call "Discover on approach". Every dungeon within
// TV_FAR_RANGE of the traveller stands on the Overworld: a discovered one is a plate with its name and distance (a
// journey there, as a far town is), an undiscovered one an unnamed mark at its place. Coming within TV_DUNGEON_FIND_M of
// an undiscovered one DISCOVERS it and says so - a departure from DFU (PlayerGPS discovers on the location's rect and
// says nothing), Mac's call, on the enhanced interface alone.
//
// A dungeon is DFU's travel-map "dungeons" filter (the map's pixel colours 0-4): a labyrinth, a keep, a ruin, a
// graveyard, a coven.
//
// PURE: the host hands the map rows, the live index, the discovery tests and each dungeon's middle; the list is rebuilt
// when the traveller's pixel (or what is known, or the index) changes, and the find is asked a few times a second.
//
// AUDIT OW3 D1: AND THE SPAWNED ONES. Online most dungeons near a player are SPAWNED (world/spawnedDungeons.js: a clone
// on an empty pixel, in no MAPS table) - Mac's "nearby dungeons", the ones its "nearby direction message" speaks of -
// and the list asked a map row of every entry, so it dropped every one. They stand here now under their own key, told
// the way that feature tells them: NOTHING until it has (it says a spawn when its pixel is entered, never before - a
// spawn next door is not said), then its mark, named once the pixel entry has filed it in the store.

 *
 * AUDIT OW3 D3: FILTERED, THEN CAPPED - the host dropped what it could not mark AFTER the twelve were taken, so a row
 * with no place to name, or a found dungeon inside the grid (TV2's own plate stands for it), spent a slot of the twelve
 * and a farther dungeon that could have been marked never was. Nothing is taken now that is not marked:
 *  - a map row (`dungeons`, dungeonRows) whose pixel holds no named place in the live index (`locAt`), or holds a spawn
 *    (the spawn's own entry speaks for it), is none; a FOUND one within `grid` (the view's grid, Chebyshev) is TV2's;
 *  - AUDIT OW3 D1: a spawn (`spawns`, spawnedPixels) is marked only once the spawned feature has told the player of it
 *    (`spawnKnown`), under `spawn:<its map id>`, and is `found` (named, a journey) once the store has it (`spawnFound`).
 *  - AUDIT OW4 D2: and never one whose time has run out (`spawnGone`, the spawn ledger's own test) - the index keeps an
 *    expired spawn until its pixel next BUILDS (spawnedDungeonAt checks the clocks there alone), so it stood as a plate,
 *    and walked, for as long as the traveller never went back.
 * AUDIT OW4 D7: THE FOUND FIRST, THEN THE REST NEAREST - the twelve were the nearest twelve whatever they were, so a
 * found dungeon (a plate, a journey) went off the Overworld behind nearer "?"s it could do nothing with. The cap is
 * taken of the found ones first, then of the unfound nearest first; what is kept is handed back nearest first.
 * AUDIT OW5 D1: AND AN UNFOUND ONE WITHIN THE GRID SPENDS NONE OF THEM - the ground the view shows (as a found one
 * there is TV2's plate and spends none). Found first, twelve found within the far range left not one "?" on the
 * Overworld, the one five hundred metres off included.
