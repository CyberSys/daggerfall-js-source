// PROF10 (2026-10-02) - THE FACET, Jewelcrafting's act at the jeweller's bench (bible/06-Systems/Professions-Arc.md 9.4:
// "The facet: a slow turn stopped where the gem catches the light (a 10-degree window)"). A piece is cut in recipeLaw
// facetCount facets (three; a gemmed piece five), each a slow turn of the stone from 0 degrees at FACET_ACT.degPerS toward
// the light, which stands at a bearing the bench draws for that facet (FACET_ACT.lightLo to lightHi - never where the turn
// begins). The press STOPS the turn: within the window about the light (recipeLaw facetWindow - the rank's and the
// band's) the facet is caught; anywhere else it is lost. A stone let turn FACET_ACT.turns times round loses its facet by
// itself, and the next is begun. Every facet caught is a clean act. Pure - a machine the bench's section of the Stores
// page ticks and presses (ui/profPages.js), as the pan is the fire's (systems/panAct.js).
//
// The act is the client's, so it may be lied about: its report moves the service by its bounded step only (5.1's honest
// bound - one quality step; the service reads `clean` and nothing else). Gentle acts cut plain: no window is shown, every
// stop counts, none is caught, and no act is clean.
