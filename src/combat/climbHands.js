// @ts-check
// CLIMB-HANDS (2026-10-02, Mac: "Here are two textures for the first person view (not morrowind)" - the raised fist
// "needs to be mirrored, thumbs inside so we can utilize 2 arms ... for hanging on a ledge, climbing, etc"; the reaching
// arm "for when you're climbing and look around for a place to jump to" - "whenever you look away from the wall your
// climbing or ledge you are hanging from", "mirrored", and "Definitely animate the arms for when you are climbing, or
// shifting left to right climbing/on a ledge"). THE CLASSIC LANE'S HANDS ON THE WALL. Design: bible/03-World/Parkour-Arc.md
// (CLIMB-HANDS, AUDIT CLIMB-HANDS).
//
// CLIMB4 lowered the classic sprite out of the screen for the climb (WeaponManager's climbing return) and left the screen
// empty; CLIMB6 gave the Morrowind arms a pose on the stone. This is the sprite lane's: Mac's two paintings,
// public/art/climb-grip.png (a fist, the back of the hand to the eye, its thumb on the painting's right - a left hand:
// drawn as it is on the left and mirrored on the right, so both thumbs are inside) and public/art/climb-reach.png (an arm
// reaching out to the right as painted, mirrored to the left).
//
// THE LAW (`ClimbHands`, pure: no renderer, no clock but the `dt` it is handed) reads the climb's snapshot
// (player/climbPose.js climbRigInput) and the view, and answers each sprite's rect on DFU's 320x200 design surface. The
// hands do what the climbing body does (AUDIT CLIMB-HANDS: ClimbPose is the one choreography - its gaits, its moves'
// windows - drawn here as a hand's way on the wall relative to the body, GAIT_PX to the metre):
//   - THE HOLD: both fists up, the arms running off the bottom of the screen; a still hang sways on the arms, the two
//     hands as one (one lip), as the body sways under them.
//   - THE SHIMMY: ClimbPose's shimmyGait - the hand the body goes toward reaches first, the other closes up after it, a
//     grip every PARKOUR_HAND_SPAN along the lip (the ear's, the 3D body's); a hand on the lip goes with the wall,
//     against the way the body goes. Stopped mid-reach, the hand finishes onto the nearer stone (ClimbPose._settled).
//   - THE FREE CLIMB: ClimbPose's gait - hand over hand, the left first, a grip every FEEL.REACH climbed (up, down or
//     across); a held hand goes down the view as the body climbs past it.
//   - THE MOVES, from where the hands were when each began (a hand not up comes from FROM_BELOW): a catch and a reach
//     onto the hold by 0.45 of the clock, a leap pushed off by 0.18 and on the new hold by 0.8, then the weight landing
//     (the arms straighten, ClimbPose's pendulum); a mantle down the view as the body rises past the hands, a press over
//     the top, let go on the pose's clock; a vault planted by 0.12, gone by 0.8; a lower onto the edge by 0.26, then up
//     to the hang as the body drops; a corner the leading hand first; a wall run's arms pumping with its steps, then up.
//   - THE GRIP FAILING: the hands tremble on the stone, harder the lower the grip (the feel's noise, the pose's rate).
//   - LOOKING AWAY: turned off the wall's face, both fists drop out of the view and the reaching arm alone comes up from
//     the other side of the screen, open toward the way the eye looks (Mac, 2026-10-02: "For look right/left dont use
//     the hand aiming straight up. Only use the angled arm").
// No pop: a change of state (a new hold, the hang to the free climb, the climb turned, a move's end) carries the hands
// from where they were onto the new place over POSE.LIMB_TAU, as ClimbPose eases its limbs; off the wall they leave from
// where they were. Every sprite's arm runs off the bottom edge with BOTTOM_SLACK to spare, so no lift shows its sleeve.
//
// The enhanced climb only (the motor's hold, a move in flight): DFU's own climb keeps WeaponManager's empty screen.
