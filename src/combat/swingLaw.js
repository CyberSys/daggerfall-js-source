// especially if we can do it better"): THE WEAPON IN THE HAND, AS THE SWING LAW READS IT. characters/weaponStates.js holds
// the law (swingFrameSeconds - the tempo of the wielder's Speed, the heft of the weapon's weight against their Strength,
// the handling of its kind) and is a leaf, so what it needs of the player is read here and registered: the held item
// off the equip table - the hand the swing is in (`ctx.usingRightHand`, AUDIT-RR F1's ctx) - its template's base weight
// and whether it takes both hands, and the live Strength. Bare hands and a beast's claws weigh nothing.
//
// Not a DFU member. Ledger A (SWING-LAW).
