// AUDIT-SEATS G5 (2026-10-01, Mac: "Finish the seats"): A SIEGE FOUGHT WITH MORE THAN THE SWING (bible/11-Multiplayer/
// Seats-Arc.md 6.1: "The blow - a claim {target, weapon kind, material, spell?} ... bows 60 m"; "Spells - at most 3
// damaging casts in 5 seconds, each clamped to 60; Teleport, Recall and Levitate do nothing in a siege room; healing a
// side-mate is allowed (ALLY-CAST's frame), clamped to 40 a cast"; "Horses are dismounted on entry"). SEAT2a part four
// sent the melee swing alone (its `r` always a swing's); PVP-REF's referee (net/siegeRef.js refereeBlow, refereeCast)
// already judges a shaft at a shaft's reach and a cast's damage or heal - this is the client's half of the rest:
//
//   - A SHAFT: the blow an arrow lands is a shaft's (SIEGE_HIT.Shaft - the referee refuses a shaft from anything but a
//     bow, and a swing from a bow), its damage rolled on the striker's own sheet as the swing's is (combat/duelCombat.js
//     resolveDuelStrike, the release's StrikeDown and the draw's time).
//   - A SPELL'S NUMBERS: the referee holds every fighter's vitality and takes a number, so a spell is landed on a stand-in
//     body through the one door every spell lands by (systems/effects.js applySpell) with sinks that only count - its
//     harm (the families a fight is made of: duelSpellOf) for a foe, its Heal Health for a side-mate. The referee clips
//     both (60, 40) and bounds their rate.
//   - THE WARDS: a spell carrying Teleport (classic 43 - its Recall the same effect's other half) or Levitate (14) is
//     refused in a battle's room with a line, before it costs anything; the motor's levitation is held off there.
//   - THE SADDLE: a rider in a battle's room is set on foot, with a line.
//
// Pure but for the one spell door (handed in for the pins), the stand-in and the rolls. Not a DFU member. Ledger A (EVERY
// PALACE A SEAT's row).
//
// SEAT2b part two (2026-10-01, Mac: "I want to finish the inprogress"; the contract's item 3): THE FIGURES AND THE WORKS
// STRUCK AS THE FOES ARE - the melee arm meets the nearest body its swing reaches among the battle's foes and, at a relay
// that knows them, the relay-run figures and the works this fighter may strike (`siegeSwingTarget`: the duel's own test -
// reach, view and sight, the host's to answer - at each body's middle); the arrows and the cast engine take the same
// bodies (scenes/world.js). A work's body is a post at its point (SIEGE_WORK_BODY_M - the Gatehouse at the Throne's point,
// the Ram at its own; the relay measures a blow's reach from the striker's pose to that point).
