// TV2 - THE TRAVEL VIEW'S PICK (bible/06-Systems/Travel-View.md).
//
// Mac (2026-09-27): "Even adding the option to tap/click to move to a
// specific location." His call on what a click means: BOTH, BY TARGET -
// a town or a marker is reached by the roads, open ground by walking
// straight there.
//
// THE RAY IS THE FRAME'S. player/tapRay.js's rayDirFromScreen turns the
// point under the finger into a direction through the very matrices the
// frame was drawn with (TI1), from the eye it was drawn from - under the
// travel view that is the RAISED eye, 150-450 m over the traveller, not
// `cam.pos`. Nothing in the tree met a slanted ray with the ground: the
// collider's raycast answers meshes, and outdoors the ground is not a
// mesh (world/collider.js). So the march is here, PURE - it takes the
// host's `heightAt` (a bilinear read of the BUILT terrain, -Infinity off
// it) and nothing else, which is what lets the pins drive it over a
// table of hills.
//
// THE MARCH: a step that grows with distance (a metre near the eye is
// wasted on a pick that lands 3 km off, and a stride of tens of metres
// can step over a ridge near it), then a bisection of the bracket the
// ray first went under the ground in. Unbuilt ground is neither ground
// nor air: the march goes on over it and says so, so a click beyond the
// built grid is told apart from a click on the sky.
