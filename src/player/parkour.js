// CLIMB1 (2026-09-30, the Enhanced Climbing arc - bible/03-World/Parkour-Arc.md):
// THE LEDGE SENSOR, THE MANTLE, THE CLAMBER AND THE VAULT. Mac: "a proper and
// detailed climbing system... Being able to latch, mantle, jump from one
// location to another ledge. Almost parkour like", after Assassin's Creed and
// Dying Light. The four calls: JUMP IS THE GRAB, THE SKILL SCALES IT (it gates
// no move), SHEER WALLS FREE-CLIMB ON GRIP, and LEAPS OF THEIR OWN scaled by
// Jumping.
//
// The port's own law, not DFU's: ClimbingMotor's classic path (climbing.js)
// has no idea what a ledge is - the wall-hug shoves the capsule over the lip
// (DISC21) - and its `AdvancedClimbing` arms (hang, rappel, corner wraps) are
// Ledger A off-road and stay so. This module is ENHANCED LANE ONLY: the motor
// consults it only when its host hands `parkour` deps whose switch answers
// yes (scenes/shared.js parkourSwitchOn), so the classic climb is untouched on
// the classic skin offline and with the row off.
//
// What CLIMB1 moves:
//   - MANTLE: a lip within reach of the hands (Jump pressed on the ground, Jump
//     held in the air, or the classic climb arriving under one) is climbed
//     onto - up the face, then over the lip - ending standing on the top, in
//     the middle of a narrow one, or crouched where only a crouch fits;
//   - CLAMBER: a top too thin to stand on (a parapet, a railing's top rail, a
//     thin fence) is climbed over onto the floor just behind it;
//   - VAULT: a lip at the waist or under whose top ends within a stride, taken
//     moving forward, is passed over and the body carries on beyond it.
// The path is SCRIPTED, not physics (the one thing both reference games do),
// and the WHOLE of it is proven clear before it starts (AUDIT CLIMB1 F2: the
// first sensor proved only the two ends, and a body stepped through railings,
// slots and lintels): every point the body passes through is a capsule the
// collider says fits, at the height the body will have there.
//
// What CLIMB2 moves (the second half of this file):
//   - HANG: a lip caught in the air at the chest or higher is HELD - the body
//     hangs under it, the eye just below the lip - and Forward (or a fresh
//     Jump) climbs up from there, Crouch lets go;
//   - SHIMMY: Left and Right move the hang along the lip, following its
//     height and a wall that curves, and stop where the lead hand finds
//     nothing to take;
//   - GRIP: a hold that runs out - its time the Climbing skill's and the
//     body's Fatigue's - and gives out when spent;
//   - FREE CLIMB: on the enhanced lane any wall is climbed without the
//     classic roll (Mac's "Free-climb on grip") - up, down and across, until
//     the grip gives; its top is a hang, and Forward over it a mantle.
//
// This module is pure - the collider is handed in - and it takes no motor
// constant at its top level: the motor imports this file, so a top-level read
// of a motor constant here would meet the cycle's TDZ. The numbers it shares
// with the motor are restated and pinned equal (test/auditclimb1, test/climb2).
