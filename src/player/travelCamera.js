// TV1 - THE TRAVEL VIEW'S CAMERA, AS LAW (bible/06-Systems/Travel-View.md).
//
// Mac (2026-09-27): "a sort of zoom out to an overworld style that
// utilizes travel options. Not a large scale zoomout, but something that
// fits ... Every detail like weather patterns, should be 1:1 in this
// mode." His call on the height: BELOW THE CLOUDS.
//
// THIS IS A RENDER EYE, NOT A PLAYER. `cam.pos` stays on the traveller's
// head, because the streaming grid, its vertical re-centre, the weather
// sample and the grass all follow `cam.pos` (what falls and the wind's
// wisps wrap round the view's own eye - OW-WEATHER, world.js `wxEye`) - a
// camera that moved it would drag the whole world behind it (the dev
// fly-cam does exactly that). This file answers only where the picture
// is taken FROM and which way it looks, over a focus the host hands it
// (the traveller's feet), and it is pure: no GL, no DOM, no host - so
// every number a player sees from up here is a number a pin can hold.
//
// THE FRAME OF REFERENCE is the port's own (world/mat4.js's law): yaw 0
// looks down +z and turns clockwise seen from above, so the forward of a
// yaw is (sin, ., cos) and the screen's right is (cos, 0, -sin); pitch
// is positive UP. The travel camera's `tilt` is the angle BELOW the
// horizon it looks down at, so its pitch is -tilt.
