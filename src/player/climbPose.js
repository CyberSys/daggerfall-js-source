// CLIMB6 - THE MORROWIND BODY ON THE WALL, THE CLIMB'S HALF (the Enhanced Climbing arc - bible/03-World/Parkour-Arc.md;
// Mac: "Definitely want you to use the morrowind model to get correct animations for everything. Be as detailed as
// possible").
//
// The motor climbs a capsule; this is what the body's limbs do about it. A law per body (the own body and its arms
// share one, every peer has its own), fed the climb a frame at a time - the hold (a lip, a face), the move in flight
// (its kind and clock), the grip - and answering, in the WORLD (metres), where each hand and each foot goes, the way the
// fingers point and the palm faces, where the elbows and knees go, how the body leans, swings and fits under its hands,
// and where the head looks. combat/climbRig.js solves that on the skeleton (whatever skeleton: it reads the bones);
// combat/fpArm.js maps it into the rig. Nothing here knows a bone.
//
// WHAT THE BODY DOES (each number below is POSE's; every target is a point on the world the motor proved - the lip it
// holds, the face it climbs - so a hand placed is a hand ON the stone, not a pose that looks about right):
//   - HANGING: both hands on the lip, the wrists just past its edge, the fingers over the top and the palms on it; the
//     arms let out straight under them (the body fitted down to their reach) and the shoulders drawn up; the toes on the
//     wall below, the knees a little bent; the head up at the hands. Still, the body sways a little on its arms.
//   - THE SHIMMY: hand over hand along the lip - the lead hand reaches, lands, and the other follows, never crossing; a
//     hand off the stone lifts clear of it; the feet shuffle after. Each hand's hold stays where it landed.
//   - THE FREE CLIMB: the four limbs climb in a diagonal gait - a hand reaches up the face every FEEL.REACH climbed (the
//     camera's own reach), the other foot half a reach after - each hold fixed to the wall while the body passes it,
//     the hips in to the wall; the head looks up to the next hold.
//   - A CATCH lands both hands on the lip at once and the body swings on them like a pendulum, harder the faster it came.
//   - A PULL-UP (the mantle from a hang or from the ground, the clamber): the hands on the edge while the body rises, the
//     feet scrabbling up the face; then the palms press on the top as the body crests it, the lead knee comes up onto
//     it, and the hands let go as the body stands.
//   - THE VAULT: both hands planted on the top it clears, the knees tucked up past it, the hands off as the body goes
//     over.
//   - THE LOWER: crouched at the edge, the hands go down to it and take it; the body turns to the wall and goes down
//     over it into the hang, the feet finding the wall below.
//   - A CORNER: the lead hand crosses to the other face first, the other after it.
//   - A LEAP: the hands let go as the body pushes off, the arms reach for the hold it flies to all the way across, and
//     take it - and the body swings there.
//   - THE WALL RUN: the feet run up the face, a step every reach; the hands reach up for the lip (or the face) the run
//     ends on.
//   - IN A LEAP'S FLIGHT (the running leap, the eject): the arms come up and forward for the catch.
//   - THE GRIP FAILING: the hands tremble on the stone and the feet scrabble for the wall.
// The weight eases in fast (a catch is a grab) and out slower; a limb's own weight lets it go (a pull-up's hands) or
// take hold (a lower's). The head's look and the shoulders' shrug are shares, never all of the rig.
