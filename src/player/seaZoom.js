// FIELD BUGS 2026-09-29 (the sea) #3 (the Discord, through Mac: "You should be able to scroll and zoom out farther"):
// THE ZOOM AT A HELM. Both third-person cameras stop where their references stop them on foot - the Morrowind
// camera's maxDistance, 800 units (11.4 m, settings.lua:43), and Eye of the Beholder's -10 (IL_12f0) - and a ship is
// 44 to 93 m long: from her wheel the wheel could not frame her. At a helm the zoom reaches out to frame the hull
// sailed - SEA_ZOOM_REACH of her largest half-extent, her mesh's own bounds (a Small Ship 66 m, the galley 140 m) - and
// past the foot's own far end each notch is a ratio (SEA_ZOOM_RATIO), so that reach is a dozen notches, never the
// hundreds the foot's own step would take. On foot, and in a boat no bigger than the foot's reach, nothing changes.
// A departure from both references, recorded in the Port-Ledger. The one home both cameras read.
