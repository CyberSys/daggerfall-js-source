// TACT1 - COVER (bible/12-Enhanced-AI/Tactics-Arc.md; Mac, 2026-10-02: "Proper line of sight with billboard props";
// his call: billboards block "Sight and missiles" - real cover, both ways).
//
// DFU's flats are billboards: a sprite with no collider, so a foe sees through a tree, a crate or a statue and an arrow
// flies through them. With the Enhanced AI switch on, every flat that reads as solid stands a COVER PROXY - an
// upright cylinder of its drawn footprint and height - in an index kept BESIDE the collider, never in it: walking, the
// navmesh and every ground probe are unchanged. A foe's sight ray, its clear-shot test and every missile (the player's
// and the foes', arrow and spell bolt) ask the index after the collider. With the switch off nothing reads it.
//
// The index rides its collider (`collider.cover`) and its sets are keyed like the collider's buckets, so a pixel, a
// building or a dungeon that leaves takes its cover with it (Collider.removeBucket). A set's points are the flats'
// own [x, y, z] base arrays, by reference, in the set's own frame; `t()` is the frame's translation (a streaming
// pixel's), so a recentre moves the cover as it moves the meshes, and a felled tree sunk in its batch sinks its
// cover with it.
