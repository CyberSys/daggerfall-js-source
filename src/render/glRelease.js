// GL-LEAK (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-03, Swololo: "After long plays there are consistent GPU memory leaks that do not lower
// down even after closing the tab ... Closing the browser down completely clears the GPU memory ... Might be related to
// some GL instances not being cleared through webgl"): THE PAGE'S CONTEXTS LET GO AS IT GOES.
//
// A WebGL context is freed when its canvas is collected - at the collector's leisure, which no GPU memory pressure asks
// for, and on Firefox the context's side lives in the separate GPU process. WEBGL_lose_context frees it NOW. Each owner
// of a context (the game's renderer, the held map's ink, the gate's veil, the intro's landscape) seats its letting-go
// here, and main.js's pagehide runs them all. A LEAF, no imports: the entry imports it, and its static reach stays
// what BOOT1 made it (test/boot2.test.js); an owner deep in the game seats itself here without the entry reaching it.
