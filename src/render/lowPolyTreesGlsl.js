// @ts-check
// LPT1 (bible/07-Rendering/Low-Poly-Trees.md): THE BILLBOARD PROGRAM'S FRAGMENT HALF OF A LOW-POLY TREE - one home for
// both lanes' billboard shaders (render/renderer.js BB_FS, render/enhancedLighting.js EL_BB_FS), which the vertex
// shader's mesh mode feeds (renderer.js BB_VS: vShade, vAlpha, vFade - 1, 1 and 1 on every flat, so a flat's texel is
// what it was).
//
// - The texel as sampled (`lptTexel`, LPT_FS_KEEP): a tree's uv wraps as the mod's own (REPEAT) - the flats' margin
//   clear, which a widened elite's quad needs, never takes a tree's texel past 1 (AUDIT LPT A7).
// - vShade: the tree's own faces lit and its material's colour, laid on the texel before either lane lights it.
// - vAlpha: what the texel's alpha is multiplied by - its material's cut brought to the flats' 0.5 (AUDIT LPT A4), and 0
//   an opaque card (the mod's *_Opaque materials), never cut by alpha.
// - vFade: THE CROSSFADE between a far picture and its 3D tree, a screen-door over bayer4 (the port's one ordered
//   dither - render/orderedDither.js): a far picture keeps a fragment where the threshold stands under its share (vFade
//   below 1), a tree where it does not (vFade 2 plus the tree's share, 1 less the picture's: 3 less it), so across the
//   band every pixel is one of the two, never both and never neither. 1 (every flat) and 3 (a tree inside the radius)
//   keep every fragment. Wants bayer4 above it.
