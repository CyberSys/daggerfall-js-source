// RETRO-UI (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-03, Skibbster on Discord: "Retro mode aspect ratio doesn't include weapon sprite, UI etc
// etc" - "a lot of elements dont account for the black bars"): THE 2D LAYER IN DFU'S CustomScreenRect.
//
// With retro mode's aspect correction on, DFU pillarboxes the WHOLE picture: SetRetroAspectViewport hands the
// pillarboxed rect to DaggerfallUI as CustomScreenRect (ViewportChanger.cs :138-140), and every root panel lays out in
// it (BaseScreenComponent.cs :1135-1137) - the HUD, the large HUD - as do the weapon (FPSWeapon.cs :128-129), the
// casting hands (FPSSpellCasting.cs :88-89) and the horse (TransportManager.cs :290-291). The port pillarboxed the world
// alone (RETRO1's recorded departure) and laid the rest out over the whole canvas: the vitals and the compass in the
// black bars, the weapon flush with the screen's edge past the picture's.
//
// THE SEAM: `uiCanvas` is the canvas the 2D layer lays out on - under the pillarbox a canvas of the pillarbox's size
// (retroScreenRect, the world rect's own pillar), else the canvas itself - and `onUiScreen` draws through the
// renderer's screen offset (the overlay letterbox seam, setScreenOffset) at its place. The weapon rig, the mount rig and
// drawHud take it themselves, so the four hosts change nothing. A click on the 2D layer comes back through `toUiPoint`.
// The client size stays the screen's (a swing's gesture reads the screen, not the picture).
