// FIX-D (2026-09-08, Mac: "the enhanced font number 5 looks like an 8").
// Pixelify Sans, the enhanced skin's face, draws its 5 with a cut
// top-left corner, and at every size and weight it reads as an 8 or an
// S - a rendering of the digits proved it is the glyph, not the
// smoothing, the weight or the shadow. The face ships no alternate. So
// the FIVE comes from Silkscreen (OFL 1.1, vendor/silkscreen-five/),
// subset to the one code point and carried here as a data URI: no
// request, 520 bytes, one glyph. The family is declared over
// unicode-range U+0035 only and stands FIRST in every Pixelify stack,
// so the browser takes the 5 from it and everything else from Pixelify.

// the skin uses under 16px, so a browser greys it out rather than lighting
// it (measured in Chromium: at 10px only 16% of a glyph's inked pixels
// reach full brightness at 400, 24% at 500; at 13px 29% against 32%), and
// its sidebearings leave about one pixel between letters, which the
// greying closes. 500 is the request's own second weight (ENHANCED_FONTS_URL
// asks for 400;500, so nothing new is fetched) and half a pixel of
// tracking reopens the gap. A rule that says its own weight or spacing
// AFTER this keeps it - so this goes FIRST in a rule (ui/touch.js was the
// one place that wrote a weight before the trio, and was turned round).
