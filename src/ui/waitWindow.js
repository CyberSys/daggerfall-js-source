// FORAGE4 - THE WAIT PAGE: Foraging's online wait (scenes/foragingWait.js)
// in the overlay slot. The port's real-time page: the wait's game minutes
// run at WAIT_PER_HOUR real seconds an hour under `tick(dt)` (townTalk.js
// hands every overlay the frame's dt), a row of dots for the wait and no
// input taken - the wait is the cost (offline the hours are gone at once),
// so it takes no Escape and its caption promises none. `interruptWhen` is
// asked every frame and ends the page early when it answers true (a foe
// near - the rest test). `onClosed(finished)` runs ONCE, when the page is
// done. And two members for the wait's queue: `remaining`, and
// `extend(seconds)` - a second `raise time by` joins the one standing.
//
// This page was Climates & Calories' hunt window (SURV6) until the text
// hunt was removed (2026-10-04); its Yes/No and result pages went with it.
