// EM3-3D — THE DUNGEON IN THE ROUND: the automap sheet's plan, lifted
// back into three dimensions and drawn by the same hand.
//
// Mac (2026-09-27): "the enhanced dungeon map doesnt work in 2d ... making
// the map like the og one in 3d again but only handrawn", with a pencil
// sketch of an isometric dungeon for the look: floors as slabs with a
// ragged, hatched underside, thick walls cut at a height, flagstones,
// stairs as steps; and "you need to zoom in rotate it and all that what
// the classic one does".
//
// WHAT IT DRAWS FROM. Nothing new is read from the level. The storeys,
// the sheets, the stairs and the reveal are `systems/automapFloors.js`'s
// (the level field the 2D plan is cut from, cell for cell), so the two
// renderings of one dungeon can never disagree about what has been seen:
//
//   A FLOOR CELL is a field cell with a REVEALED surface on this sheet's
//   storeys, standing at that surface's own height - so a flight of steps
//   is a run of cells climbing, and needs no stair model of its own.
//
//   A WALL CELL is an empty cell touching revealed floor (eight ways),
//   cut WALL_RISE above the highest floor it touches. It is a whole plan
//   cell thick, which on Daggerfall's one-metre grid is the sketch's own
//   proportion to a corridor.
//
//   AN OPENING is an edge onto the sheet's floor not yet seen, or onto a
//   stair's far side on another sheet (`pass`): no wall, a broken rim.
//
// THE CAMERA IS THE WINDOW'S VIEW, TURNED. The held window pans and zooms
// a flat space ({ox, oy, scale}, clamped by the sheet's size) and knows
// nothing of yaw or tilt. So the sheet's space in solid mode is the plan
// turned by `yaw` about its middle and foreshortened by `pitch`: an
// orthographic projection whose ground plane at the live sheet's height
// is exactly the window's flat space. At pitch 90 and yaw 0 it IS the 2D
// plan's space, unit for unit. Panning and zoom-to-cursor therefore stay
// the window's own code; only a turn or a tilt has to move the view, and
// the sheet hands that back through `reframe`.
//
// THE PAPER SHOWS THROUGH. The ink is laid on a transparent layer over
// the parchment, and a surface that must HIDE what is behind it is first
// cut out of the layer (destination-out) and then washed at a
// watercolour's strength. The paper's cracks and stains stay visible in
// every floor and every wall, and a wall still hides the room behind it.
//
// Pure except for the painters, which take a context and are guarded on a
// real 2D one, as every painter in this lane is.
