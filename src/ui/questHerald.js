// GUIDE3 (2026-09-29, Mac: "How can we set the foundation and improve the
// quest system substantially? Like really modernize it, make it more
// accessible", then, of the Quest Guide arc: "This is your baby. Take
// your time"): THE HERALD - a quest's news, said where the enhanced skin
// says news.
//
// WHAT DFU SAYS. Nothing. A quest's `log` is a bare addLogStep, `end
// quest` files the notebook in silence, and a clock inside its last day
// is a number the player must open the logbook to read. DISC6's player
// said what the silence costs (bible/01-Overview/Field-Bugs-2026-09-23.md):
// "Theres no quest notification when you killed all monsters and no quest
// update in the log". The quest's OWN words - its `say` popups - are the
// quest's and stay exactly where they are; what the herald adds is the
// journal's news, that it changed, which DFU never said at all.
//
// WHERE IT SAYS IT. The enhanced skin's notice stack (ui/enhancedNotice.js,
// ENH-NOTICE1/3): one toast per quest - its kind first ("New quest",
// "Journal updated", "Under a day left", "Quest completed", "Quest
// ended"), then its title, then one line: the newest entry's opening
// (ui/questRail.js entryOpening) or the time left. The stack is
// `aria-live` polite, so a screen reader says the news the parchment never
// could. The classic skin never draws it - DFU says nothing, and the
// classic skin is DFU's - and the enhanced skin's `quest-herald` switch
// (systems/features.js) takes it off: Ledger A row "A QUEST'S NEWS IS A
// NOTICE".
//
// THE MODEL IS ONE HOME, THE DRAW IS THE STACK'S (ui/levelNotice.js's
// shape, LV2): the queue and its clock live in QuestHerald below, pure -
// no DOM, no clock of its own - and the draw hands its frame to
// drawEnhancedToasts each HUD frame, as ui/hudText.js hands PopupText's.
//
// WHO FEEDS IT. The quest bridge (scenes/questBridge.js), after each
// machine tick: one lens look a tick, and only while the herald is
// listening - so a player who never hears it never pays for the look.
//
// ITS CLOCK IS THE HUD'S. ui/hud.js drawHud - the one call all four hosts
// make - draws it and ticks it with the frame's REAL seconds (a news line
// is the port's page, not the world's: at a journey's time scale it would
// otherwise be gone before it was read), and the tick is dead under any
// open window, DFU's own HUD law (DaggerfallUI.cs:429-433, which
// midScreenText keeps): news that lands as a window opens waits for the
// window to close rather than expiring unread.
