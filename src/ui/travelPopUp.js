// W1-ii: THE TRAVEL POPUP - DaggerfallTravelPopUp.cs (MIT,
// Daggerfall Workshop; original author Lypyl) on the real
// TRAV0I04.IMG. The F-slice collected these three choices on single
// keys over a text panel; this is the classic window itself, laid
// out rect for rect, with the LAWS still living in
// systems/travel.js exactly as C# leaves them in
// TravelTimeCalculator.
//
// THE NATIVE-WINDOW RULE, element by element:
// - the art panel is TRAV0I04.IMG at (49, 28, 223, 97) (:54).
// - three TOGGLE PANELS, 4.75x4.75 virtual px of flat (85,117,48)
//   green, parked over whichever option is live (:64-71, :261-275).
//   DFU prefers a "GreenCheckbox" texture out of its own Resources
//   folder and falls back to that colour when it is missing
//   (:155-161); the port has no DFU asset bundle, so the colour arm
//   is the only arm - recorded, not a departure of behaviour.
// - the three labels at their own anchors (:133-139): available
//   gold (148,97), trip cost (117,107), travel time in DAYS
//   (129,117), all DaggerfallUI.AddTextLabel - which means the
//   DEFAULT shadowed style (TextLabel.cs:40-42), not a plain draw.
// - six option buttons in two columns (:57-62) and BEGIN/EXIT at
//   the right (:55-56); the hotkeys are DialogShortcuts' own - B
//   begin, E exit, S speed, T transport, N inn/camp out - and since
//   A8 they are READ from that table (systems/dialogShortcuts.js)
//   rather than transcribed into this file.
//
// THE FLOW, law for law:
// - defaults are cautious / SHIP / inns (:85-87). The F-slice window
//   defaulted travelShip false; DFU's field is true and the toggle
//   panel starts on the ship row.
// - a CLICK on one of a pair picks that pair member (sender ==
//   button: :501, :521, :541 inside the handler block :497-556);
//   the HOTKEY toggles instead (:505-509, :525-529, :545-549), so
//   S/T/N flip where the clicks assign.
// - BEGIN refreshes, then warns when the player carries a disease or
//   poison (a random TEXT.RSC 1010 variant behind Yes/No, :421-427)
//   before the gold check; not enough gold shows TEXT.RSC 454 and
//   refuses (:388-403, :458-468).
// - travel then runs DFU's countdown: one day per 0.05s of REAL
//   time ticked off the days label, and only when it empties does
//   the trip happen (:229-246, :305-320).
// - the ARRIVAL is the host's (scenes/world.js fastTravelTo) - the
//   F-slice put performFastTravel's order there and it stays there.
//
// THE GOLD IS TWO POOLS, not one. GetGoldAmount is coins plus every
// letter of credit in the pack (PlayerEntity.cs:1313-1316 over
// ItemCollection.GetCreditAmount), and DeductFastTravelGold takes
// the INN NIGHTS out of coins alone before letting the rest reach
// the letters (:469-473) - "Taverns only accept gold pieces". The
// port has letters as real tender (court.js's DeductGoldAmount
// spends them), so both halves are live here and in the host's
// deduction; the label above shows the COINS, as DFU's does.
//
// TP1 landed two of these: GuildManager.FastTravel's membership
// discount (:284 - the Temple of Akatosh's, the only one in the game)
// and RaiseSkills on arrival (:380), both of whose "no seam yet"
// blockers had retired without the sentence moving.
//
// D4 CLOSED BOTH OF THIS WINDOW'S LAST TWO SENTENCES.
//
// THE SMASH AND THE FADE (:242, :381). ui/fadeLayer.js is
// FadeBehaviour.cs whole; the smash is where Update puts it - the
// frame the countdown reaches zero, immediately before
// performFastTravel - and the fade from black is the last thing
// performFastTravel does (:381), which is the host's half of that
// method (scenes/world.js `fastTravelTo`) exactly as the arrival order
// has been since the F-slice. So the days tick down, the screen
// smashes black on the last one, and the new pixel fades up.
//
// EXIT'S KEY-UP DEFERRAL (:482-495). A DFU Button raises
// OnKeyboardEvent for BOTH edges of its Hotkey and only falls back to
// a faked click on key-down when nothing is subscribed
// (Button.cs:79-92). Four of this window's buttons subscribe. THREE of
// them - speed, transport, inn/camp - act on KeyDown only (:504-508,
// :524-528, :544-548), which is what the port already did. EXIT is
// the one that splits: KeyDown plays ButtonClick and arms
// `isCloseWindowDeferred`, KeyUP clears the flag, kills doFastTravel
// and pops the window. So E held down is a popup that stays open with
// its click already played, and the window closes on the release.
// `keyup` below is that edge; ui/travelMapWindow.js routes it and the
// townTalk overlay seam forwards it from the hosts' existing keyup
// listeners, which had bound the edge and never used it.
