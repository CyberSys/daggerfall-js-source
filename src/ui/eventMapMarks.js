// EVENT-TIP (2026-09-28, Mac, answering how the gate's sealed hours should read: "I also want to add a tooltip to the
// map for these type of events. I think we should fold in the raid PR in the repo, since it has a new type of world
// event also"): THE WORLD'S EVENTS ON THE HELD MAP, AND THE CARD EACH ANSWERS A HOVER WITH.
//
// Two kinds stand on the enhanced map: the Oblivion Gate's ring (WB1, ui/gateMapMark.js) and a TOWN UNDER ATTACK
// (RAID1, systems/raidingParties.js) - a raided town while its raid runs: begun, not withdrawn, not cleansed. Each
// answers the pointer with a TIP: a small card at the cursor saying what it is, where, and when it ends - the words the
// chat said once, kept where the player can ask again (the field's player, looking at a ring that said only "Oblivion
// Gate", could not). The held map asks in the order the player means (ui/heldMap.js _hoverLabel): a party member, a
// raided town, a place's mark, the gate's ring (it holds an area; a town inside it answers as the town), the province.
//
// PURE. The host (scenes/world.js) hands the map FUNCTIONS - `gate` (the omen's mapMark, its tip with it) and `raids`
// (raidMapMarks over the raids' state now) - and neither map learns what a raid is. The classic region page is DFU's
// window: it draws the gate's ring, as it did, and no raids and no card (the native-window rule).
//
// Not a DFU member. Ledger A (EVENT-TIP).
