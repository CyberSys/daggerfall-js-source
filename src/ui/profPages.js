// PROF1 (2026-09-28, Mac: "actual UI integration for life skills") -
// THE PROFESSIONS AND STORES PAGES of the character sheet: two pages on
// the pause window's Stats rail (ui/enhancedMenu.js), beside Character,
// Attributes and Skills - the sheet's own bones (bible/06-Systems/
// Professions-Arc.md 8, 21, 22). Online only, and only while the
// professions are this account's: the host registers its book here
// (`setProfessionsPages`), and a page with nothing behind it is never
// drawn (PX14's drawn door).
//
//   THE PROFESSIONS PAGE - the thirteen in two groups, Gathering and
//   Crafting, each a row with its rank, its rank's name and a thin bar;
//   the chosen one below: the XP to the next rank, today's harvests, the
//   specialisation cards at 50 and 100 (choose one - a change of mind
//   costs 1,000 Marks and a week, and is pressed twice), the unlocks by
//   rank, and the crafter's limit.
//   THE STORES PAGE - the materials with their counts, own and bought;
//   the families to filter by, a search, the sort; a material's action:
//   Withdraw to pack, a quantity. (Delivering to a writ is the Notice
//   Board's Work tab; listing comes with the market, PROF5.) PROF2: THE
//   FORGE under it - the smelts, while the player stands at a forge (a
//   Weaponsmith's or an Armorer's, its fee a smelt; a home's forge).
//   PROF3: THE ANVIL beside it. PROF4: the Forge burns logs to Charcoal,
//   and THE WORKBENCH - the saws and Carpentry's recipes, with the plane
//   - while the player stands at one (a Furniture Store's, its fee a
//   craft or a saw; a home's workbench). PROF7: THE LOOM - the tanning
//   rack's cures, the weave, and Outfitting's recipes with the stitch and
//   a garment's dye - at a Clothing Store (its fee a craft, a cure or a
//   weave) or a home's loom. PROF11: THE MASON'S BENCH - the cut (Rough
//   Stone to Cut Stone) and the mix (Mortar) with the chisel, and the
//   Sculptor's stone decor - at a General Store (its fee a cut, a mix
//   or a carving) or a home's mason's bench. PROF9: THE FIRE - Cooking's
//   dishes with the pan, at any lit fire (a campfire, a hearth, a
//   brazier), no fee. PROF10: THE JEWELLER'S BENCH - Jewelcrafting's
//   pieces by piece, metal and gem, with the facet, at a Pawn Shop or a
//   Gem Store (its fee a piece) or a home's jeweller's bench. PROF12:
//   THE ALCHEMY STATION - DFU's twenty brewed from the Stores (no act:
//   DFU's windows stay 1:1), the Apothecaries' sixteen bought where a
//   cauldron is short, a Transmuter's transmutations - at an Alchemist's
//   (its fee a brew) or a home's alchemy station; THE ENCHANTING STATION
//   - the pack's crafted pieces disenchanted into Arcane Essence, at a
//   Mages Guild hall (its fee a piece) or a home's enchanting station.
//
// The pages draw with the menu's own kit (its `el`, divider and meter,
// handed in), so they are the sheet's pages and not a second window.
