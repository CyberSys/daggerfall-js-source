// BOAT-MARK (2026-10-01, the field: a Large Boat put in from its deed,
// her owner killed aboard her and woken at a temple - "is there any way
// to know where your ships are located at?", then "I want to build a
// compass icon that tracks your boat"): YOUR BOATS ON THE COMPASS. A
// Large Boat's deed and a Rowboat's parts are spent on placing
// (systems/comeSailAway.js takePlaceItem), the boat is kept where she
// was left, and nothing in the game said where that was - the compass
// marked the sea's ships (scenes/navalHost.js compassShips), never the
// player's own. Now every boat Come Sail Away keeps for me stands on
// both compasses (ui/hud.js drawBoatCompassMarks, ui/enhancedHud.js) as
// a little boat in one sea-glass teal, from anywhere on the street,
// however far off she lies:
//   - a boat in sight (her pixel within one of mine - UpdateBoatVisibility's
//     law) is marked where she floats;
//   - one out of sight is marked where she floats while that place still
//     stands on her own map pixel in this frame (every recentre and every
//     teleport carries her: OnPositionUpdate, OnWorldReanchored), and at
//     her pixel's middle when it does not - a dungeon's boat, which stands
//     in the dungeon's own frame, or a frame a load never carried her into;
//   - none for the boat at my helm, nor for one I stand at
//     (BOAT_MARK_NEAR_M), whose bearing would swing with every step.
// The colour keeps clear of every other mark on the strip (the party's
// green, the Detect markers' red, the gate's ember, the quest's gold, the
// ships' red, bone and grey, the professions' five - test/boatmark.test.js
// holds the distances), and the shape is its own: a sail over a hull.
// A leaf - it imports nothing, so the HUD takes it without taking the
// sailing runtime.
