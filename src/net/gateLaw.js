 * round of four gates (gates 4k to 4k+3) brings all four aspects and two trials a gate, and a pair of trials rests a
 * long while before it comes back, under another aspect each time. (AUDIT PRE-MERGE 0929 W1-4: this said "every four
 * gates" - any four running do NOT, and no cycle of every set once could.)
 * Built so: the trials (relabelled by the salt's shuffle) sit at the round-robin's SEATS and fall into its perfect
 * matchings - every pair in exactly one; a ROUND is one matching under one turn of the aspects (pair j wears aspect
 * j + s), so its four gates share nothing; the matchings, in the salt's order, run under the first turn, then the same
 * ones under the next, and so on. Each round's gates stand in its own shuffled order, its first and last chosen, depth
 * first, so the seam between two rounds shares nothing either - the cycle's last gate and its first included, for it
 * comes round again. The same cycle on every client and the relay; made once.
 * WB11a (2026-10-01, Mac: "4. Trial rotation" - the ninth trial, Legion-Lord): NINE TRIALS. An odd count cannot be
 * paired whole, so the circle method sits one out: a BYE takes the last seat, and the trial a matching pairs with it
 * RESTS that round - nine matchings of four real pairs, 4 x 36 = 144 gates (twelve real days); each round brings every
 * aspect and eight of the nine trials, the ninth a different one each round; a pair rests 33 gates at least. (Eight
 * trials, WB8b's, were seven matchings and 4 x 28 = 112, every trial each round, a pair resting 25.) It needs the
