// GUILD1d (2026-09-30, Mac: "Lets do this") — THE GUILD HALL
// (bible/11-Multiplayer/Seats-Arc.md 8.2).
//
// A guild owns ONE home as its hall, bought from its gold treasury at
// the home's own price and half again, and owned by the GUILD, never a
// character: its row in the homes table names the guild (`guild_id`),
// and its character is the guild's own mark (guildHallOwner) - no
// character's id can ever be it, so no character's path (a home's sale,
// its decor, its rooms, its outside) reaches a hall by a character's
// name. Members walk in (the `guild` entry, the hall's default) or
// anyone (`public`); the Officers and the guildmaster furnish it; its
// sale pays the deed share back into the treasury. Server-wide one
// owner a building, as every home (HOME1).
//
// Its own module, beside net/guildLaw.js and never inside it: guildLaw
// is in the relay's bundle (GUILD1c - the token carries a guild), where
// every byte is a relay deploy (test/relayversion.test.js SLAM8), and
// nothing of a hall is the relay's.
//
// The shapes BOTH ends read - the account service
// (server-account/src/halls.js) and the client. Pure: no clock, no DOM,
// no network.
