// MOD1 — THE MODERATOR'S CHAT COMMANDS, and the words around them.
//
// Mac: "a moderator glyph and moderator chat commands" - /mute and
// /unmute (his pick, of the four offered).
//
//   /mute <name> [minutes]    minutes defaults to MUTE_DEFAULT_MIN
//   /unmute <name>
//
// THIS SIDE DECIDES NOTHING ABOUT AUTHORITY. It parses, finds the
// account a name belongs to, and asks. The account service decides
// whether the asker may (MODERATOR_HANDLES / DEVELOPER_HANDLES) and
// signs an order; the relay checks that signature. A moderator's
// client that skipped every line here could do nothing a player's
// could not - which is the point of putting the authority where it is.
//
// A NAME IS NOT AN ACCOUNT. Two guests can share a generated name, so
// the name typed is resolved against the players the relay has named
// in this room, each of whom carries the VERIFIED account (`sub`) the
// relay read off their token. Two matches is a refusal, never a guess:
// muting the wrong person is worse than muting nobody.
//
// Pure, and every side effect is an argument, so node drives it.
// Imported by the account Worker for MUTE_MAX_MIN, so the service and
// the command agree on the bound in one place.
