// PROF5 (2026-09-29, Mac: "Continue") - THE MARKET: what a listing, a
// sale, a courier and a buy order are, and every bound both ends read.
// The record is bible/06-Systems/Professions-Arc.md 10.2-10.5 and 26.
//
// A LISTING is a Stores material (escrowed by the service - the units
// leave the Stores at once) or a crafted piece with a provenance id (the
// piece leaves the save), at a price in Marks, for 72 hours, standing on
// every board of the region it was listed in. A buyer in that region
// takes it at once; a buyer anywhere else pays the COURIER and waits for
// it - so a signature material is cheap at home and dear abroad, and
// hauling is a trade (10.2).
//
// THE ROAD. The courier is charged by the map pixels between the two
// regions' hub towns (HUB1). The service holds no ARENA2, so it learns a
// hub's pixel the way it learns a pixel's climate: from the clients that
// derived it (SEAT0 3.2's witnessed world, `world_witness` kind `hub`).
//
// Pure: no clock, no DOM, no network. Both ends read it.
