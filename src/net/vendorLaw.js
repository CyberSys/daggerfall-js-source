// HOME-VENDOR (2026-10-03, Mac: "add the ability for players that own houses to buy npcs that sell goods for them when
// someone visits the house ... make the available npcs visible on the board with a tab and item search filter"; asked,
// "Yes only in the house and you should be able to set a waypoint where the trader is ... Selfplaced npcs should sell
// stuff waaaaay longer").
//
// A VENDOR is a placed piece of a home's decor made the `vendor` station (net/decorLaw.js DECOR_STATIONS) - its licence
// is the station's fee, paid once on the owner's record, as every station's. Its STOCK is market listings of pieces from
// the owner's pack, for gold (MARKET-ANY's route, server-account/src/market.js listGood), carried AT THE VENDOR: such a
// listing stands on no regional board and is bought at its vendor alone, by a visitor standing in the house. It stands
// VENDOR_LISTING_S, not the market's 72 hours. The proceeds are the market's gold (market_gold), collected at any board.
//
// The Notice Board's Vendors tab lists the region's vendors and their stock, searched by the item, the owner or the
// town; a row sets a waypoint on the trader's house.
//
// Pure: no clock, no DOM, no network. Both ends read it.
