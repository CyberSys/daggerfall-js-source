// HERALDRY-SHOWN (2026-10-02, Mac: "lets finish the build work") —
// EVERY GUILD'S HERALDRY THE CLIENT HAS BEEN TOLD, BY ITS TAG.
//
// Seats-Arc 8.1: the heraldry is drawn on the guild tag's frame, the
// siege HUD and the Chronicle. None of those carries it on its own wire
// (a peer's token names its tag alone, the fight's answer its guilds'
// names and tags, a Chronicle row the names and tags as they were that
// day), so each face reads it, by the guild's TAG (one guild a tag - the
// guilds table's unique; a Chronicle row's by its name too, AUDIT
// HERALDRY H3: a disbanded guild's tag may be reused), off what the
// client already holds: the seats' list (each holder's guild and its
// battle's two), a dressed seat, a
// seat's standings, and the reader's own guild.
//
// The client's alone, beside net/heraldryLaw.js rather than in it: that
// law is bundled by the relay and the account service, and an index
// neither of them reads is no change to what they run. Pure: no clock,
// no DOM, no network.
