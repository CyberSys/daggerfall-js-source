// WB8b (2026-09-28, Mac: "Make the oblivion gate boss not be able to be pacified, continue to refine and add detail to
// his encounters, and give him unique and different modifers on every 2 hour spawn"): THE WARDEN'S MARKS - what each
// gate's Warden comes marked with. Every gate (one a game day, every two real hours - net/gateLaw.js) he wears ONE
// ASPECT - which of Oblivion's powers his elemental blows carry - and TWO TRIALS - what else the court asks of his
// challengers. The day's marks are drawn from shuffle bags (net/gateLaw.js gateModsOf): no two gates running share an
// aspect or a trial, and every one comes round in turn. WB11a: nine trials - the ninth, Legion-Lord, brings his host.
//
// A MARK IS NAMES AND NUMBERS HERE; its law is the fight's profile (net/gateBrain.js fightProfile), read by the relay
// that runs him and by every screen that draws and resolves his blows - one law, both ends. The relay says a fight's
// marks in its state (`md`), so a screen reads the fight it is in, whatever the day's draw would say.
//
// PURE and a LEAF: no imports - the relay's bundle (net/gateBrain.js, net/gateLaw.js, net/wire.js) reads it.
//
// Not a DFU member. Ledger A (WB8).
