// @ts-check
// SERPENT2 (2026-10-04, the owner: "the discord integration needs to happen"): THE SERPENT'S HERALD - what the relay's hub
// posts to the world events' Discord channel for the sea serpent, and when: DISCORD-GATES' law at sea (net/gateHerald.js).
// The bells - fifteen real minutes before it rises - pinging the opt-in role, and the kill, once a serpent day.
//
// PURE, and the relay's (server/src/index.js - the hub posts, off its alarm): this imports serpentLaw.js, gateHerald.js
// and wire.js, all three the relay's already. Nothing here fetches; the hub hands Discord what these build.
//
// - THE DOOR: the gate's channel (GATE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK). The role the bells ping is SERPENT_DISCORD_ROLE when the
//   operator names one, else the gate's own (GATE_DISCORD_ROLE).
// - WHEN: the bells at their own instant (serpentLaw.js SERPENT_OMEN_MINUTE), posted late while the serpent has not risen
//   yet (a hub asleep through the instant, a deploy), never after; the kill when a cell tells the hub, once a serpent day,
//   while it is still news.
// - WHERE, AND WHICH KILL: the relay holds no map, so the site is the players' word, as the gate's is - each online game
//   says the site it found (`serpent` `site`, wire.js), one word an account a day, and the site named is the one the most
//   accounts said once GATE_SITE_AGREE of them agree (gateHerald.js foldGateSite and agreedGateSite - one law for both,
//   the site's native point to the whole unit in the gate's pixel slots). A cell keeps a fight for every site named to
//   it, a forged one too (AUDIT SERPENT S1), so the channel hears the kill AT THE AGREED SITE alone: a forged site's
//   fight, however it ends, never reaches it. Until a site is agreed the bells name no place (it is ringed on every map)
//   and a kill waits.
// - SAFE TO POST: gateHerald.js's law - the one role named in `allowed_mentions`, a name or a place held to letters,
//   digits, spaces and a little punctuation.
//
// Not a DFU member: Daggerfall has no other players and no Discord. Ledger A (SERPENT2).
