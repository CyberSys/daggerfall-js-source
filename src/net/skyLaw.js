// TIME1 (2026-10-01, Mac: "people have to wait insanely long, werewolf forms last insanely long" / "I don't want a
// band aid, I want a detailed way we can do this" / "Let's do it. This needs to be perfect"): THE SKY'S OWN CLOCK.
// Design: bible/06-Systems/Online-Time-Arc.md.
//
// Online two clocks are functions of wall time. WORLD5's (wire.js sharedClassicMinutes, TimeScale 12, a day every two
// real hours) is THE EVENT CLOCK: the relay's gates, raids and rows, the economy, every term and every stamp - its rate
// never changes. This file is THE SKY: the hour, the date and the moons a player sees, at a rate of its own. Nothing
// walks the sky and nothing is stamped on it - it is read for "now" - so its rate is a dial that moves nothing else.
//
// A LEAF, AND NEVER THE RELAY'S. wire.js is in the relay's bundle and test/relayversion.test.js binds RELAY_VERSION to
// every byte of it, so the sky lives here, outside the relay's import graph (test/time1_sky.test.js holds it out); the
// account service bundles it through nodeLaw.js, whose UTC days take their season from the sky. It imports wire.js
// alone, so neither graph grows past this one file.

/**
 * TIME1: the sky's segments, oldest first. From `fromMs` (relay-clock ms) the sky runs at `minutesPerMs` classic
 * minutes per real ms; before the first segment the sky IS the event clock. Each segment starts at the minute the one
 * before it reached, so a new row turns the dial again with no jump. Each `fromMs` is an ALIGNED instant
 * (`node tools/skyCutover.mjs` lists them): there the old sky's hour already equals the new schedule's, so nothing
 * skips at the switch and the new rate's midnights fall on whole fractions of the real day for good - at TimeScale 24
 * on the hour (test/time1_sky.test.js pins both).
 *
 * The first switch must not fall before the build that carries it is live: a tab that loads after it reads the new sky
 * at once, so the sky would jump once at the deploy. Nothing stores the sky, so that jump is only seen, never kept -
 * but if a merge lands after `fromMs`, move it to the next aligned instant instead.
 * @type {ReadonlyArray<Readonly<{fromMs: number, minutesPerMs: number}>>}
