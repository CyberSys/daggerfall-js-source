// GUILD2b (2026-10-03) — THE GUILD'S VAULT: ITEMS THE GUILD KEEPS, AND WHO
// MAY PUT IN AND TAKE OUT (bible/11-Multiplayer/Guild-Overhaul.md).
//
// Asked: "guild item storage with the leader able to grant and revoke
// perms". The vault is a guild's shelf of items - any piece a trade
// could carry (net/realmTradeLaw.js tradeableRecord) - held on the
// account service, never in a save: a piece put in leaves the
// depositor's realm record in the same batch that writes it to the vault,
// and one taken out enters the taker's record the same way (server-
// account/src/guildVault.js), so a vault is never a copy of anyone's pack.
//
// WHO MAY: each member stands at a level - NONE, DEPOSIT (put in) or
// WITHDRAW (put in and take out) - with, for a withdrawer, the most takes
// they may make a UTC day. A rank sets the default (VAULT_RANK_DEFAULTS);
// the GUILDMASTER grants any member another level and limit, and revokes it
// back to the rank's (`null` - the rank's default). The guildmaster's own is
// WITHDRAW, unlimited, and is no one's to change.
//
// The shapes and bounds BOTH ends read. Pure: no clock, no DOM, no network.
