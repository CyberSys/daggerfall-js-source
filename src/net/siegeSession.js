// SEAT2a part four (2026-10-01, Mac: "Finish the seats"; "Or we could go ahead and do sieges"; "Continue"): A SIEGE AS
// THIS CLIENT FIGHTS IT (bible/11-Multiplayer/Seats-Arc.md 6.2-6.8, 19) - entered from the board's Seat tab while the
// battle's door is open: the field this game derived from the town (systems/siegeField.js) sent for a pass (the service
// settles the field on an attacker's and a defender's agreeing - until then it asks again, said in words), then the
// battle's own room joined (`siege:<key>:<week>`, a fresh pass on every hello - net/online.js mintSiegePass), `in` said
// once a socket is open; the room's words folded (net/siegeLink.js) and drawn (ui/siegeHud.js); a step refused or a rise
// at the camp moves the player there; a blow on a foe sent to the referee; at the end this fighter's receipt kept and
// carried to the service (net/siegeClaims.js), its Honours on the card. Left at the window's close or by the player -
// the world's own room is joined again.
//
// The world is handed in (`online`, the book's two calls, the HUD, the clock, `movePlayer`), so the pins drive it with
// fakes. Not a DFU member. Ledger A (EVERY PALACE A SEAT's row).
//
// AUDIT-SEATS (2026-10-01): C1 - A BATTLE IS LEFT: by the player (the HUD's Leave, the result card's Close, the chat's
// `/leave` - scenes/world.js), when the player has been away from the seat's town BATTLE_AWAY_MS (`here`), when the
// battle's socket is closed for good, and at the window's close; the HUD is drawn only while the player stands in the
// battle's room (a building's room is not the field). C2 - the one mint slot (net/online.js mintSiegePass) is cleared
// only while it is this session's own. C3 - an unsettled field is said ONCE and asked again on a backing-off wait (5 s,
// 10, 20, 40, then every 60 s), so the service's hourly bound on passes is never reached. C7 - every settling answer to
// this fighter's receipt reaches the card (a refusal in words), so it never stands on "claim it".
