// @ts-check
// OW6L (2026-09-29, the product owner: "Everything needs that persistence between players in the overworld."): THE
// OVERWORLD'S LEDGER, AS A CELL KEEPS IT - one a cell room (net/wire.js worldRoom: sixteen map pixels square), in the
// cell object's storage, so every player in the cell agrees: the ones standing in it now, and the ones who walk in later.
//
// WHAT IT HOLDS - the two things the Overworld could not share before:
//   - THE SPENT. A roaming band (systems/travelBands.js, `b<cx>.<cy>.<life>`) and a Warm Ashes raider
//     (systems/seaRaiders.js, `r<cx>.<cy>.<life>`) are born of the land and the shared clock - every player computes the
//     same ones with no word said - but one a player fought or escaped was told only peer to peer (a foes frame's `bd`),
//     to the players within three map pixels at that moment and to nobody after. The ledger keeps each spent id through
//     its own life and the next (the client's own bandPrune: a band two lives gone is nobody's), OW_CELL_SPENT_MAX of
//     them, the oldest out first.
//   - THE SPAWNED DUNGEONS' CLOCKS (world/spawnedDungeons.js TTL1: a spawn is gone two game days after it was cleared,
//     seven after it was first seen). The roll that stands one on a pixel is a pure hash every client shares; its two
//     clocks were each client's own, so two players disagreed whether one was gone. The ledger keeps a row a pixel -
//     `[px, py, seen, cleared?]`, shared classic minutes - and MIN-MERGES: the earliest first sight and the earliest clear
//     anyone has said. So a spawn's clocks only ever run out sooner, never wind back, and every machine that folds the
//     same rows, in any order, holds the same row. OW_CELL_ROWS_MAX of them (the oldest first sight out first), each let
//     go OW_ROW_KEEP_MIN after its first sight - sixty real days, long past both clocks, so a spawn that went stays gone.
//
// WHAT THE RELAY CAN CHECK, it checks: an id's shape, and its life - this one or the last, on the relay's own clock; a
// row's pixel on the map and its SPAWN ROLL (a pixel the roll leaves empty holds no dungeon, and the roll is pure), its
// clear no earlier than its first sight, both inside the keep's window; and every pixel - an id's cell origin, a row's
// own - inside the receiving cell's square widened by OW_CELL_MARGIN_PX (a band met at the seam, a dungeon a pixel over
// the edge). WHAT IT CANNOT: whether a band was fought, and when a pixel was first seen - those are the players'
// machines' word (co-op's law: the relay has no world to see them in); and with no map files it cannot say a pixel is
// sea or road. It holds what it was told inside its window, its cell and its roll, and nothing else.
//
// PURE - no storage, no socket, no clock of its own: the relay (server/src/index.js) and the session (net/online.js)
// hand the moment in. It imports the wire (the cell's arithmetic, the shared clock's law, the frame's shapes),
// net/gateLaw.js (the relay's copy of the spawn hash) and net/raidLaw.js (two clocks' skew) - all three the relay's
// already, so the worker's graph grows by this file alone. The band's, the raider's and the spawn's own numbers are
// PINNED EQUAL here, never imported (gateLaw.js's law for this very hash): their modules reach the map files, and every
// byte this file reaches is the relay's deploy - test/ow6_ledger.test.js holds each copy to its home.
//
// Not a DFU member: Daggerfall has no other players, and no Overworld.
