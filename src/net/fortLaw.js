// Seats-Arc.md 6.2, 7.5, 7.7, 4.2's Siege Camp; Appendix B). Fortifications belong to the SEAT, not the guild: a

// Season's end, and Season 0's end wipes them (18).
//
// THE MATERIALS (PROF0 section 4, net/professionLaw.js's keys): the table's "Cut Stone" `stone:cut`, "Oak Planks"
// `plank:oak` (and Pine, Cherry, Teak, Mahogany), "Iron/Steel/Mithril Ingots" `ingot:*`, "Pearls" `gem:pearl`.
// DECIDED: the table's bare "Silver" and "Gold" are the raw metals `metal:silver` and `metal:gold` - it names an ingot
// "Ingots" wherever it means one, and no gold ingot exists.
//
// Pure (it reads professionLaw.js's materials and its Builder). Not a DFU member: Daggerfall's towns have no player
// works. Ledger A (EVERY PALACE A SEAT's row).
