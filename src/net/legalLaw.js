// TERMS1 — THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND THE PRIVACY POLICY, AS BOTH ENDS
// SEE THEM.
//
// 2026-09-28: "Here is our terms of service and privacy policy. I wanna
// make sure these need to be reviewed and checked off by players before
// creating an account".
//
// ONE HOME BOTH ENDS, the move handleShape.js made for the name shapes:
// the Create account form sends the versions a player ticked, and the
// account service refuses to make an account unless they are the
// versions it holds (server-account/src/accounts.js `legalRefusal`).
// Neither end may keep its own copy. A form and a service that disagree
// about which text is current would record an agreement to words nobody
// showed the player.
//
// A VERSION IS ITS DOCUMENT'S "LAST UPDATED" DATE, because that is how
// the Terms say a revision is marked (section 15). The pages carry it as
// `<time datetime>`, and test/terms1.test.js holds each page's date to
// its version here and each page's words to a hash - so the text cannot
// change without somebody deciding whether that is a new version.
//
// A NEW VERSION IS A DEPLOY OF BOTH ENDS. The site and the account
// Worker ship separately, so for the minutes between them a player on
// the other side is told the documents changed and to reload. That is
// the price of never recording a version the service does not hold.
//
// THE URLS ARE ABSOLUTE ON PURPOSE. The desktop app loads the game from
// its own dagger:// scheme and hands only http(s) links to the system
// browser (app/main.cjs), so a relative link would open nothing there.
