// DISCORD-GATES (2026-09-28): THE GATE'S HERALD - what the relay's hub posts to a Discord channel, and when. The field's
// player: "add a discord channel that tells the gates in real time itll create hype and make more join"; Mac: "Discord
// live gates?", then the moments - "Omen (15 min before), Boss slain" - and "Ping an opt-in role" (on the omen alone),
// and for the place, "What do you need for discord": the players' own games say where the gate stands.
//
// PURE, and the relay's (server/src/index.js - the hub posts, off its alarm): this imports gateLaw.js and wire.js
// alone, both already the relay's. Nothing here fetches; the hub hands Discord what these build.
//
// - THE DOOR: a channel's webhook (GATE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK, a Worker SECRET - its URL is the key to the channel) and the
//   role the omen pings (GATE_DISCORD_ROLE, a var - a role's id is no secret). No webhook, no herald: the relay posts
//   nothing and keeps nothing for it.
// - WHEN: the omen at its own instant (gateLaw.js GATE_OMEN_MINUTE - fifteen real minutes before the gate opens), posted
//   late while the gate has not opened yet (a hub asleep through the instant, a deploy), never after; the kill when a
//   gate's object tells the hub (`_gateFellInternal`), once a day, while it is still news.
// - WHERE: the relay holds no map file, so the place is the players' word - each online game says where it found the
//   gate the clock is about (`gate` `site`, wire.js), one word an account a day, and the place is the one the most
//   accounts said, once at least GATE_SITE_AGREE of them agree: one lying client names nothing. Until then the post
//   says no place (the gate is on every map).
// - SAFE TO POST: every mention is the one role the operator named (`allowed_mentions` - Discord pings nothing else,
//   whatever the text holds), and the words a player can reach - the place, a fighter's name - are held to letters,
//   digits, spaces and a little punctuation, so no markdown, no link and no mention rides them.
//
// Not a DFU member: Daggerfall has no other players and no Discord. Ledger A (DISCORD-GATES).
