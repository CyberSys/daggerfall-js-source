// AUDIT-SEATS G1 (2026-10-01, Mac: "Finish the seats"): THE BATTLES ANNOUNCED IN THE SERVER'S VOICE (bible/11-Multiplayer/
// Seats-Arc.md 6.3: "Announcements - in the server's voice (RED1's red text, and EVENT1's welcome record for late
// joiners), at the Turning and 24 hours, 1 hour and 5 minutes before: 'The Silver Hand <SH> has won the Right of Siege at
// Anticlere. The Ebon Oath <EO> holds its Charter. Battle is joined Wednesday at 20:00 UTC.'"). SEAT2a part one left them
// the relay half's; no relay keeps a clock of the week's battles, so they are this client's, CROWN2's red lines' way
// (net/townSeatBook.js sayRed): a timer off the seats' list.
//
// WHAT IT SAYS: each battle the list names this week at a seat this client's own derivation holds (a seat it lacks is
// never honoured), in its announcement's words (net/townSeatLaw.js battleAnnouncement), in red on every chat tab, at four
// marks - the Turning that placed it (its seat week's start), 24 hours, 1 hour and 5 minutes before battle is joined -
// and never once it is joined. ONCE A MARK A BATTLE A PAGE: a mark said is never said again however often the list is
// read; a page opened late (EVENT1's late joiner) hears the latest mark passed, once, and not the ones before it - the
// record, then the marks still to come. A line the chat cannot take yet (none made) is offered again the next second.
//
// THE SCHEDULE: the list names each battle's kind and two guilds but not its start (server-account/src/seatInfluence.js
// battlesOf - the rights, not the placed battles), so the start is read ONCE a seat a week from that seat's standings
// (`fight`: its start in seconds, `moved`, `state`) - or from the list itself, where it carries `startsAt`, which spares
// the read (asked of the service: AUDIT-SEATS's report). A void battle is never announced.
//
// SEAT2b part two (2026-10-01; Seats-Arc 7.7): A REVOLT is announced the same way - the list's battle `kind: 'revolt'`,
// its holder `against` and no challenger (`guild` null) - in its own words, battleAnnouncement's revolt arm ("Anticlere has
// risen against ... Its rebels hold the palace door"), at the same four marks.
//
// Pure - the list, the read, the chat and the clock are handed in. Not a DFU member. Ledger A (EVERY PALACE A SEAT's row).
