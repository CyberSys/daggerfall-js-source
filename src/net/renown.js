// RENOWN1 (2026-09-24) — RENOWN: online's own level, kept beside
// Daggerfall's and never in its place.
//
// Mac, bringing a friend's MMORPG pillars ("The Hybrid Leveling System
// ... a traditional EverQuest-style Adventuring Level ... which dictates
// total health, magicka"): "What if the leveling system was something
// seperate unique to online but compatible". Asked three things, Mac
// answered: the online health and magicka go "On top" of Daggerfall's,
// the curve is a long "Grind", and offline play earns "No" XP - "Plus
// having their level appear on the left side of character name and
// profile main menu + ingame profile". Then Mac named it: "Lets
// officially call this Renown" - it was built as the Adventuring Level,
// and every name in the code, on the wire and on screen says Renown.
// A player's Renown is a level ("Renown 12" in words), and beside a
// name it is the number alone, in a box (Mac: "Just have it read 12
// inside a box").
//
// ═══ WHAT IT IS, AND WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES ═════════════════════════
//
// A TRACK PER CHARACTER, kept by the account service
// (server-account/src/renownTracks.js) and never in the save. RENOWN1
// kept a track a character; RENOWN-ACCOUNT (2026-09-28, Mac: "can you
// make sure renown is account based and not character based?") made it
// the account's for a day; RENOWN-CHAR (2026-09-29, Mac: "Can we make
// renown per character again") gave each character its own back -
// migration 0035: each track at what it held when Renown became the
// account's, plus everything the account earned while it was (Mac's
// choice, "Own + recent gains"), and a realm character with no track yet
// at those gains alone. RENOWN-ACCOUNT's slower grind stays (below).
// The Daggerfall character - its level, its skills, its health and magicka,
// the save file itself - is exactly what it was, offline and online, so
// a character can go back and forth between the two forever.
//
// Online, and only online, the level adds `renownBonus(level)` to the
// character's maximum health and magicka: a layer put on when
// the character comes online, taken off when it leaves, and never
// written to a save (systems/renownLayer.js).
//
// ═══ WHOSE WORD IT IS ══════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// XP is earned by the player's own client - a kill, a quest - because
// every kill online is already the client's own call. So the SERVICE
// holds the bounds: at most RENOWN_XP_REPORT_MAX a report and
// RENOWN_XP_HOUR_MAX an hour per ACCOUNT, across all its characters - a
// second character is not a second allowance. The LEVEL is the service's
// alone: it derives it from the character's total, signs it into the
// identity token (`lv`, net/identityToken.js), and the relay stamps it
// beside the name, so nobody's level over their head is their own word
// about themselves.
//
// PURE, and both ends import it: the account Worker bundles this file
// (account-deploy.yml's path filter is held to its import graph), and
// the client reads the same numbers. No clock, no DOM, no network.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/* ═══ THE CURVE ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * EverQuest's shape: for a character new to Daggerfall the first levels
 * come in minutes, level 10 in an evening, level 20 in a few weeks of
 * evenings, and level 50 in hundreds of hours. The XP follows the level
 * of what was fought, and a class foe stands at the character's OWN
 * Daggerfall level (characters/enemyEntity.js), as does a quest's pay -
 * so a character that levelled offline climbed ten times faster online
 * (AUDIT RENOWN1 DATA-6), until RENOWN3 read every foe and quest against
 * the character's Renown (below), and RENOWN-ACCOUNT paid every source three
 * quarters of it (RENOWN_RATE_PCT): at Daggerfall level 30, Renown 10 is 79
 * kills and Renown 20 is 531 - 59 and 398 at the full rate, 19 and 228
 * before the ceiling. Offline play itself still earns nothing. THE CURVE
 * DID NOT MOVE: the grind is slower because every source pays less, never
 * because a level costs more. The total to reach level L, with n = L - 1:
 *
 *     10 * floor((n^3 * (n + 10) + 300 * n) / 30)
 *
 * INTEGER ARITHMETIC ONLY, and that is the reason for the shape rather
 * than a tidier `n ** 3.6`: a fractional power is rounded differently by
 * different engines, and the service, the relay and three browsers must
 * agree on every boundary to the unit. The largest intermediate is
 * about seven million, far inside a double's exact range.
 *
 *     level  2       100      level 20     68,200
 *     level  5       690      level 30    319,950
 *     level 10     5,510      level 40    972,770

/* ═══ WHAT EARNS IT ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A KILL is worth its foe's own level: RENOWN_KILL_XP_PER_LEVEL to the
 * level at the full rate, a rat 10 and a lich 200 - 7 and 150 at
 * RENOWN_RATE_PCT (below). The level is the one the game already rolled
 * for that foe (a monster's fixed level, a career foe's level off the
 * player's), so the XP follows what the fight really was. No "con"
 * colours: the curve already makes a small foe worth less and less of a
 * level.
 *
 * A QUEST is worth what its giver scaled it to: Daggerfall sizes a quest
 * to the character's own level, so the XP does too.
 *
 * RENOWN3 (2026-09-25, Mac: "a high level character shouldnt blow through
 * online levels"): BOTH ARE READ AGAINST THE CHARACTER'S RENOWN (the account's
 * while RENOWN-ACCOUNT stood, the character's again since RENOWN-CHAR). A career foe stands at the character's own
 * Daggerfall level, and a quest is sized to it, so a character that
 * levelled offline fought level-30 foes from its first minute online -
 * Renown 10 in 19 kills, Renown 20 in 228. Now a foe, and a quest, is read
 * at most RENOWN_OVER_MAX levels above the Renown: at Renown 1 a level-30
 * knight pays like a level-4 foe, and the ceiling rises with every level. A
 * character new to Daggerfall fights foes at or under the ceiling almost
 * from its first kill and earns what it did (fighting level-5 foes, one
 * kill more in 150 to Renown 10 and none in 1,844 to Renown 20: a level-5
 * foe is one over the ceiling at Renown 1); a Daggerfall level-30 character
 * takes 79 kills to Renown 10 and 531 to Renown 20. It still climbs faster
 * than one fighting level-5 foes (150 and 1,844) - a harder fight is worth
 * more, up to the ceiling - but not ten times faster. (Every count here is
 * at RENOWN-ACCOUNT's rate; at RENOWN3's full rate they were 59 and 398,
 * and 111 and 1,365.)
 *
 * RENOWN-ACCOUNT (2026-09-28, Mac: "reducing the accumulation of renown
 * from resources a bit. Want some more oomph to the grind"): EVERY SOURCE
 * PAYS RENOWN_RATE_PCT - three quarters - of what it paid. The rate is
 * taken in ONE place, `renownRate`, floored to a whole XP there and nowhere
 * else, so the client, the service and the relay agree to the unit
 * (INTEGER ARITHMETIC ONLY, the curve's own law): a kill's ten a level is
 * 7.5, so a level-3 foe pays 22 and a level-30 foe 225; a quest's 100 and
 * 40 a level are 75 and 30, whole already; a raid is three quests, so it
 * follows; the party's bonus rides on the kill's rated XP, so its base
 * follows too. A gate pays no Renown of its own - its foes are kills.
 *
 * A PARTY earns MORE per head, never a share: every partymate in the
 * room earns the whole kill, plus RENOWN_PARTY_BONUS_PCT a head beyond the
 * first - group play is where the big numbers are (the pillar's own
 * words: "Group play is the prime source for farming huge chunks").

 * carries at most RENOWN_XP_REPORT_MAX (a minute of the fiercest fighting a
 * group does, several times over), and an ACCOUNT earns at most
 * RENOWN_XP_HOUR_MAX in a clock hour - RENOWN-ACCOUNT took it from 20,000
 * to 15,000, a quarter off as every source is. A solo character or a small
 * party never meets that bound; a full party of eight against the fiercest
 * foes can (383 XP a kill at level 30 with the whole party's bonus - about
 * forty kills an hour), and that is the bound's price, paid by the
 * strongest play alone (AUDIT RENOWN1 DATA-6). A client that lies every
 * hour of every day still takes 155 hours (2,318,660 / 15,000) - about six
 * and a half days - of doing nothing else to reach the cap, because the
 * hour's window only moves FORWARD (renownTracks.js: a report stamped with
 * an hour already past is charged to the window that is open, never given
 * a fresh one - AUDIT RENOWN1 SEC-1/DATA-1).
