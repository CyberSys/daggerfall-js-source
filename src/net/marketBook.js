// PROF5 (2026-09-29, Mac: "Continue") - THE MARKET'S BOOK: what the
// Market tab reads and every act it asks (server-account/src/market.js,
// bible/06-Systems/Professions-Arc.md 26).
//
// THE BOARD'S SHAPE (net/noticeBook.js): a minute's cache of every read -
// a refusal too - a slow service showing the last good view, marked stale;
// every act one at a time, given up after the door's fifteen seconds and
// tried again on the words that mean "not yet" (offline, server, the
// account gate's minute spent), and kept through the ones that mean "not
// now" (no session yet, a session let go - AUDIT 30 C1).
//
// THE PROFESSIONS' SHAPE (net/profBook.js): what moves a piece in or out
// of the save is KEPT before it is asked (ASYNC NEVER DROPS) - a piece
// listed (taken out of the pack first, put back on a refusal), a piece
// bought here, a piece cancelled back, a piece collected - and let go on
// the answer BEFORE the piece is minted, so a mint that throws is never a
// second mint; a kept act whose answer was lost is asked again with the
// same id when the tab next settles, and the service's `repeat` answers it.
//
// PROF5b: an auction posted is a listed piece's act (kept, put back on a refusal) with its own route; a bid is an
// order's (its id kept for a press asked again - it moves Marks, and the won piece comes by delivery).
//
// GOLD-MARKET (Professions-Arc 10.8): A GOLD BUY MOVES THE BUYER'S RECORD. A realm character's gold is its record's, so
// a gold listing is bought through the host's realm act (systems/realmSaves.js realmGoldAct): the purse checkpointed,
// the exact cost taken out of it as the service is asked (`reserve` - the service's batch pays the record the same, or
// neither), given back on a refusal. It is KEPT too, as a Drakes buy is: an answer lost ends the realm session (a join
// reads the record), and the tab's next settle asks it again with its id - a sale that landed answered as the repeat
// (its piece minted, nothing paid again), one that did not landed now (the cost paid off the purse on the answer). The
// gold a character's sales hold comes in by the same act (`collectGold`), into the board's bank account as the record's.
