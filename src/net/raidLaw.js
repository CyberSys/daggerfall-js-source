// RAID3 (2026-09-27, Mac, on World Events - Raiding Parties online: "1. Server" - the relay tracks each raid's kill
// count, kept even if everyone leaves, the cleanse and the participants, and signs the rewards): A TOWN'S RAID, AS THE
// RELAY KEEPS IT. Design: bible/03-World/Raiding-Parties.md, "The relay holds the raid (RAID3)".
//
// THE LEDGER lives in the raided town's CELL (net/wire.js worldRoom - the room every player standing in the town is
// in), one a raid, in the cell object's storage for the raid's window and RAID_KEEP_MS past it: so a raid's count
// outlives everyone leaving it, and the next player to walk in fights on from it. It is fed by the players' WORDS -
// each, every few seconds while they stand in the town during its raid: the raid they stand in (its key, its start,
// its target, its party and its town's map pixel, as the day's own roll made them - RAID1), the deaths of THEIR OWN
// raiders so far, and whether they have struck a raider (the renown stamp). The first word keeps what the raid is
// (WOD7's law: the first claim keeps); every word after it adds only its deaths and its speaker.
//
// WHAT THE RELAY CAN CHECK, it checks: a word is heard only inside its raid's day and window (the shared clock -
// WORLD5), in the cell its town stands in, from a socket whose own pose stands on the town's pixel; a raid's count
// grows no faster than raiders can stand (RAID_KILL_MS: the mod stands one every one to ten seconds), and a share
// said past that is CLIPPED, not refused - the rest is credited as the raid runs on; each account's share is the most
// it has said (RAID2's law - a share is never taken back, and a speaker who says it again adds nothing). WHAT IT
// CANNOT: a kill and a blow are the players' own machines' word (co-op's law - the relay has no world to see them
// in), and it has no copy of the day's schedule (no game data), so it holds a raid it was told of in its window, its
// cell and its pose, and no other. The account service bounds the record (RAID4).
//
// THE CLEANSE is the ledger's: the count at the target, stamped ONCE, with a receipt (net/raidReceipt.js) to each
// account that EARNED one - it struck a raider (said) and stood in the town at the cleanse (a word within
// RAID_PRESENT_MS), the mod's own law (it paid a player on the town's pixel at the cleanse; RAID1 fix 5: one who
// fought). One receipt an account a raid.
//
// PURE - no clock, no storage, no socket: the relay (server/src/index.js) hands in the minute and the millisecond, and
// the pins drive it as the relay would. Imports nothing, so the worker's graph stays flat (guildLaw.js's law).
//
// Not a DFU member. Ledger A (RAID1's row).
