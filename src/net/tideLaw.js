// SEASON1 part two (2026-10-01, Mac: "Finish the seats"; "Continue"; "Hurry up"): THE TIDES - the world moving under the
// war (bible/11-Multiplayer/Seats-Arc.md 9.3). Each seat week rolls one Tide for each of the three kingdoms, one for the
// Marches (the three regions share it) and one for the Free Lands - a pure function of the week and a salt, as the gate's
// site is (net/gateLaw.js gateHash), so every client, the service and the relay roll the same Tide with nothing sent.
// Everyone knows the coming week's Tides at the Turning: the Seat tab says both.
//
// DECIDED: a Tide rolls only while a Season is counted (townSeatLaw.js seasonOf - the service's SEASON_ZERO_WEEK); with
// none, every land is Calm, so nothing the Tides touch moves before the seats open.
//
// Pure, a leaf both ends read (the professions' yields and the market's couriers read it too). Not a DFU member:
// Daggerfall's world has no weekly tides. Ledger A (THE WAR RUNS IN SEASONS' row).
