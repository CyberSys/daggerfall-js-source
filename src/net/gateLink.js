// telegraphed attacks"): WHAT THE CLIENT HOLDS OF A GATE'S FIGHT - the relay's words (net/wire.js validGateOut, off the
// court's room or the hub) folded into one state: the boss's health, where he stands and walks, the attack in flight,
// his phase and shield, the kill and the wrath, and this account's receipt. The court draws from it (WB4 - the body,
// the telegraphs, the bar); the gate in the world reads its `fellAt` (a gate whose boss fell collapses on every screen).
//
// PURE in its fold (`foldGate`): a state and a word in, the next state out - the pins drive it as the session would.
// The link around it keeps the state, the falls by day (the hub's word reaches players who were nowhere near the
// court) and says a refusal in words once.
//
// Not a DFU member. Ledger A (WB).
