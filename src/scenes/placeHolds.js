// FIELD BUGS 2026-10-04b PLACE-LRU (the Discord: "After long plays there are consistent GPU memory leaks that do not
// lower down even after closing the tab ... Related to play length ... Idling does not increase mem usage"; a player's
// follow-up: "world instances are cached. visiting new cities generates a mesh for them but does never dispose of them
// after leaving that place ... needs to have a limit of chunks being stored with minimum set for chunks visible by
// viewing range"): THE PLACES' HOLD ON THE SHARED GPU CACHES.
//
// What a place builds for itself alone already goes with it - a streamed pixel's terrain, merged statics, flats and
// tilemap (scenes/world.js destroyPixel), a building's and a dungeon's batches and merged statics (the two contexts'
// destroy()). What places SHARE is the data pipeline's (scenes/dataPipeline.js): every model's VAO and buffers
// (`gpuMeshes`, with its CPU copy in `cpuModels`), every picture (`renderer.textures`, `emissionTextures`) and every
// ground archive's tile array (`renderer.tileArrays`) - and nothing ever let any of that go. A town's own buildings, a
// climate's walls and roofs, a dungeon's blocks and its foes' frames stayed on the GPU for the rest of the session,
// so the three grew with every place visited and never came down: the player's claim, for the shared half.
//
// So each place HOLDS what it asks for (`place(kind, key)` - a pixel, a building, a dungeon), a model holds the
// pictures its own build uploaded, and a thing asked for OUTSIDE any place - the UI, the foes outdoors, the arrows, the
// fixed city of ?exterior - is PINNED, kept for good, which is what everything was before. A place that goes is not
// dropped at once: it is KEPT, the most recent per kind, so a walk back across a pixel's edge or a step out of a door
// and back in rebuilds nothing. Past that the oldest is dropped, and what no place holds and nothing pinned is freed.
// The places in view are live and never dropped - the player's "minimum set for chunks visible by viewing range" is
// the view itself; what is kept is the cache past it. A place that comes back holds what it asks for again, and what
// was freed is built again by the same doors that built it the first time.
//
// Pure: no GL here, and no pipeline - the frees are the caller's (`free.mesh/tex/tile`), so a pin drives the law with
// counters.
