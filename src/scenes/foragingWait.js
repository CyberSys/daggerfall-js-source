// FORAGING'S ONLINE WAIT, COMPOSED FOR A HOST - bible/06-Systems/
// Foraging.md 13.1. Online the shared clock is nobody's to move
// (WORLD5), so Quest Actions Extension's `raise time by H:MM` is a wait
// the player sits through instead: the busy page C&C's hunt already has
// (ui/huntWindow.js - THE ONE CONSTRUCTION SEAM, with `ask`, `escape`
// and `result` off and `interruptWhen` a foe near), at C&C's
// HUNT_WAIT_PER_HOUR real seconds a game hour (huntRealSeconds,
// imported, not copied).
//
//   entity         - the player; `foragingWait` on it is the wait's
//                    record - `{ seconds, label, held }` - so the
//                    seconds left and the boxes held behind them ride
//                    the save, and a reload reopens the page with them
//                    (systems/save.js ENTITY_FIELDS)
//   showOverlay(w) - the slot; overlayActive() - whether a window
//                    holds it (the tool's result box, the pack)
//   enemiesNear()  - the rest test, the host's (duel included)
//   online()       - the shared clock is on
//   revive(keep)   - a held box the save kept, shown again (AUDIT 28 F6)
//
// THE ORDER: the tool's result box and the pack close first - the page
// opens only when the slot is free; then the page takes the slot; the
// quest's own boxes (a bonus's line) are held behind it and shown, in
// order, once it has ended AND left the slot (`holds` / `hold` - AUDIT
// 28 H6: released inside the page's own last tick, each box went under
// a page still in the slot, and the finished page came back over it). A
// second wait joins the first (`extend`) - the SUM, never cut (AUDIT 28
// F1: twenty tool uses queued behind one page cost sixty-four seconds).
// A foe near ends the page with what is left forgiven; so does a window
// that takes the slot from under it (the page's dispose). The quest
// machine pauses while the page holds the slot, as it does under every
// window (the host's frame ticks it only with the slot free).
