// COME SAIL AWAY - ANOTHER PLAYER'S BOAT, BOARDED (CSA-K, SAIL-TOGETHER, 2026-09-28; the player's ask: "I want people
// to be able to sail together, to walk on board as it moves"). The mod is single-player: its boats carry their own
// player at the helm and nobody else, and online another player's boat was a thing to see (CSA-J) - no deck to stand
// on. Here it is one to stand on, and to be carried by while its owner sails:
//
// - ABOARD. A player comes aboard another's boat by its own ladder - BoardBoat (112401) answers on it as on one's own:
//   stood at the board position, facing its forward, set on its deck (systems/comeSailAway.js boardPlaceOf) - or by
//   landing on its deck from above (off a pier, a jump, a fall): the ray down from the body's centre - the riders' own
//   ray (FixedUpdate casts each rider's height down from its centre), CSA_ABOARD_BELOW longer so a fall is met before
//   it lands - meeting the boat's colliders no higher than a step over the feet. A swimmer is never taken aboard by the
//   ray (inside a hull the ray meets its floor from within): the ladder is the way up out of the water, as in the mod.
// - THE DECK HOLDS ONLY WHO IS ABOARD. Another player's boat never walls anyone out (PR-WAGON1, Mac: "Others' wagons
//   don't block"): its colliders stand in a player's own collider only while that player is aboard it, re-stood as it
//   moves (the host's csaSyncColliders), and gone the moment they are not.
// - CARRIED. Each frame, once the peers' boats are posed, the one aboard is carried by their boat's move - its root's
//   pose before the frame and after (scenes/comeSailAwayPeers.js moveOf): the feet kept at their place on the deck and
//   the facing turned with the boat about up (carriedPoint and yawDelta, the helm's own law for its child), in the air
//   over the deck too (a jump on a moving deck comes down where it left it) - and never across a jump of the boat's (a
//   snap, a boat rebuilt), which puts them off.
//   Aboard is the motor standing on the boat, or in the air over its deck: a body standing on anything else (a pier
//   over a moored boat, the shore under its bow) is not aboard, and is never dragged away by the boat's going.
// - OFF. Walking or jumping off its side (the ray meets nothing of it and the motor stands on nothing of it), standing
//   on something else, swimming, the boat gone (packed, its owner gone from the room, a clear) or the host's own
//   leaving (a transition, a fast travel, a death, the mod off) puts them off at once, the colliders with it; the motor
//   falls or swims as ever. The ladder's first frames are its own (CSA_ABOARD_GRACE): the body stands on the deck only
//   once the motor has stepped there.
// - SEEN ON THE DECK. My place aboard - whose boat, which of theirs, and my feet in its own frame - rides my foes frame
//   as `ab`, a word only when it changes (standing still on a moving deck says nothing). Every reader stands me on their
//   own copy of that boat at that place (`glue`): its owner on the boat they sail, the others on the one they lead - so
//   the deck I walk is the deck they see me on, never a stride behind it. The owner law is the boats' own: a word
//   replaces the sender's alone, a sender gone or quiet past the stale time takes theirs, a clear takes everyone's.
