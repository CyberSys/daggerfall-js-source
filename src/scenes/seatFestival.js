// FESTIVAL-STAGE (2026-10-02, Mac: "lets finish the build work") - A
// FESTIVAL'S MUSIC, BANNERS AND LANTERNS (bible/11-Multiplayer/
// Seats-Arc.md 7.6: "Festival - music, banners, lanterns"). SEAT1d built
// its Festive buff (systems/seatEdicts.js); this is the town dressed for
// it, while a Festival rules there - the holder's Edict as the seats'
// list dresses the seat (net/townSeatLaw.js festivalRules). Nothing on
// the relay or the service: each client stages it off its own list.
//
//   THE MUSIC: the street's City music becomes the Tavern's - DFU's own
//     tavern playlist (systems/songManager.js TAVERN_SONGS: SQUARE_2,
//     TAVERN, FOLK1-3; FM: FM_SQR_2), the day's song as a tavern picks
//     it - in the town's streets (scenes/shared.js createMusicDirector).
//     Indoors, each building keeps its own.
//   THE BANNERS: more of the holder's banners on the seat banners' own
//     cloth (scenes/seatBanners.js, render/bannerPass.js) - two beside
//     each tavern's door, and a pennant over each board BOUNTY1 took for
//     its hunts (the rumour boards carry the seat's already), at most
//     FESTIVAL_BANNERS_MAX, measured where the pixel is built.
//   THE LANTERNS: one hung before every banner the town flies (its seat
//     anchors and the Festival's), in the street's own lantern pool
//     (world/cityLights.js fillLanternPool) - lit with the town's lamps
//     at dusk, flickering on their own slots, chosen nearest as they are.
//
// Online alone. Four hosts: world.js WIRED (the streets); worldModes.js
// and dungeonContext.js stand no street; exterior.js (the bench) runs no
// account service, so no Festival rules there.
