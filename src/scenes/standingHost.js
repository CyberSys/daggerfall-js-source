// REP1 + REP5 (2026-09-29, the reputation overhaul - systems/standing.js holds its law): THE WATCH'S STOP AND THE LAW'S
// NOTICES, for the two street hosts (world.js, exterior.js). One home, so the hosts cannot disagree about when the watch
// stops a known criminal or what a changed standing says.
//
// THE STOP (Mac: "Challenged on sight"). DFU's watch came for a hated name by a 5% roll every game minute - no guard
// needed to be anywhere near. Here a wandering GUARD who can SEE the player (cityGuards.js guardSeesPlayer: the witness
// arm's own eye, the line clear) stops a known criminal - a standing under -10 in the region, or a banishment standing
// (standing.js knownCriminal) - at most once in two game hours per region and never inside the grace an answered law
// gives. The box asks three things:
//   P - pay the fine on the spot (the court's own Conspiracy penalty, in coin; double when banished) - a day's grace;
//   S - come quietly: a Criminal Conspiracy, charged once, and the court - whose sentence gives the charge back (REP2);
//   R - refuse: the Conspiracy held and the watch called as a seen crime calls it (the chase, DFU's own from there).
// The box has no Escape: the watch wants an answer. Only on the street, never under another window, never in a trial,
// never for a transformed lycanthrope (DFU's SuppressCrime: the beast is nobody's face), never on a crime already held
// (the chase is already under way).
