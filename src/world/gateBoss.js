// WB4 (2026-09-25, Mac: "a large boss arena with an oversized enemy with telegraphed attacks (like wind ups, etc)"):
// THE BOSS AS HE IS SEEN AND HEARD - where he stands and what he is doing at a moment of the relay's clock, the frame
// of Daggerfall's own sprite that shows it, the glow on him and the words of his voice. Design:
// bible/11-Multiplayer/World-Bosses.md section 5 ("On him: the sprite holds its attack frame's first half through the
// wind-up, glows the attack's colour, and his voice gives the wind-up's cue; at the landing the attack frames play out").
//
// PURE. The court's state (net/gateLink.js, the relay's words folded) and a clock in; a pose, a light, a cue out. The
// court's driver (scenes/gateCourt.js) turns them into a billboard, a light in the court's channel and sounds.
//
// HIS BODY is the mobile the look names (a Daedra Lord for Valkynaz Ruhn - archive 286, the frames every client
// already has) drawn at BOSS_SCALE times its size, the orientation tables and clip rates its own (characters/
// mobileUnit.js). The frames an attack shows are the attack clip's (records 5-9): its first two HELD through the
// wind-up - the raise, the second from half way - and the rest played at the clip's own 10 a second from the landing.
// The charge is run on the walk's frames at a run's pace, his body carried down the lane as the brain carries it.
//
// Not a DFU member. Ledger A (WB).
