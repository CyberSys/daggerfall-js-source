// UNDER-LOOK and UNDER-RAYS (FIELD BUGS 2026-10-01 #4, #5): "Underwater
// should have a water look to it, not as clear", and "Underwater should
// have sun rays that dynamically show through the water". The port's own
// look over Iliac Puddle No More's sea, a DEPARTURE from the mod (Mac:
// "We're our own thing now"); what the mod draws - its distance fog
// (deepWaterLook.js distanceFogUniforms, per fragment in every world
// program) - stands, made thicker here and coloured over by the port's
// pass (render/deepWatersRender.js drawUnderwaterLook).
//
// Why the sea read as clear: the mod's fog leaves a pixel at the eye
// untouched and takes it to the fog's colour over its vision distance
// (66.5 m at the sliders' defaults), absorbing ~2% of its red a metre;
// the world fog over it is a thin neutral grey; nothing tints the water
// body and nothing lights it. So a swimmer at 2 m saw the seabed 20 m off
// at four fifths of its own colour, and no hue at all.
//
//   THE MURK: the mod's vision distance, times UNDERWATER_MURK - every
//   term the fog derives from it (the absorption and scatter per metre,
//   the bands it closes over, the sky's distance) follows, so the
//   sliders still scale it as they did.
//   THE BODY: a pixel of the frame becomes c * keep + body - the water
//   takes red first, then green; it keeps less, and adds less light, the
//   deeper the eye and the darker the day.
//   THE SHAFTS: the sun, refracted at the surface (Snell, n = 1.333), lit
//   through a drifting pattern of the surface's focus - each point the
//   view's ray crosses is lit by the surface where the light reaching it
//   came in - so the rays lean with the sun, converge toward it, sweep as
//   the surface moves and fade with the eye's depth, with night, and
//   with a cloud over the sun (the frame's own sun scale).
//
// Pure: the pass reads these; test/fb1001_underwater.test.js pins them.
