// RAID2 (2026-09-27, Mac, on World Events - Raiding Parties online: "1. Server 2. Keep ..."): A TOWN'S RAID,
// SHARED. The day's raids were already the same on every client (RAID1 rolls them off the day's own generator), but
// each client would have stood its own raiders, so RAID1 stood down online. Now ONE player runs a raid - WOD7's law
// for a marker two players sprang: the first to claim it keeps it, two claims inside RAID_CLAIM_WINDOW_MS go to the
// smaller id, and with no claim heard the smallest id standing in the town claims it. Its raiders ride its cell
// stream tagged with the raid's key (`rz`) and every reader stands them under an allowance of their own; its
// defenders ride as the watch does, named as the player's allies (`al`), so a reader stands them as its allies too;
// and every owner's word on the raids it fought (`rk`: the raid, the deaths of its own raiders, how long ago it
// claimed the raid) rides beside them - a raid's deaths are every owner's summed, so a runner who stands down keeps
// its share and the next runner counts on from there. Validated here, at the reader; the relay reads a frame's
// record count and nothing else. No wire or relay change. RAID3 moved the count into the relay (Mac's "1. Server" -
// net/raidLaw.js): where the relay speaks raids its count and its cleanse are the raid's, and these words elect the
// runner alone.
