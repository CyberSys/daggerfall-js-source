// BROKER-CAGE (2026-10-02, Mac: "she should be present at the site in a jailed gate, and the gate opens after all the
// enemies are cleared"): THE SIGIL BROKER'S CAGE, MADE - cut from the gate's own stone (world/gateModel.js faces,
// GATE_ARCHIVE), as the faithful's circle is (world/riteModel.js): corner posts, a ring of bars on three sides and
// either side of its door, a frame and bars over the top, and the door itself, a barred leaf on its hinge. Its walls in
// the collider are plain slabs apart from the bars (a body meets a wall, never slips between two bars).
//
// THE CAGE'S OWN FRAME: x across, z through its door (the door on its +z face), y up from her feet - the host turns it
// with trs's yaw (world/mat4.js: local +z faces the bearing). AUDIT BROKER-CAGE G6: ITS FOOT IS THE GROUND'S - the host
// samples the ground under its corners and builds its bars down to the lowest of them and CAGE_FOOT_UNDER beyond
// (`foot`, never less than CAGE_FOOT), so a cage on a slope never stands on air; and its door's sill clears the ground
// it swings over (`sill`). The door is made in its HINGE's frame (x along the leaf from the hinge, z out of the cage)
// and swung by the host about the hinge (`cageHinge` - the left jamb's inner face), CAGE_DOOR_OPEN when it is open:
// outward. AUDIT BROKER-CAGE G5: no two faces of it lie in one plane over each other (the leaf between the jambs, the
// jambs under the beam, the posts capped over it). Pure.
//
// Not a DFU member. Ledger A (WB).
