// IT1 (2026-10-04): IMMERSIVE TRAVEL'S CARRIAGES, AT WHICHEVER GATE THE TOWN STANDS.
//
// The mod's whole world edit is four of Daggerfall's city-gate blocks, WALLAA08-11, each with records appended: a
// carriage (model 41214) and its team or a cart (41207, 41209, 41109), the horses (TEXTURE.201), a hay or a crate
// flat, and the driver - a person flat in faction 8642, Carriage Drivers, whose click is the "Fast Travel" service
// (systems/immersiveTravel.js). Its four files are carried as WD1 patches of the player's own classic blocks
// (vendor/immersive-travel/WorldDataPatches, tools/immersiveTravelPatches.mjs).
//
// THE DEPARTURE (the owner's choice, "Add carriages to either"): Beautiful Cities ships the same four names - its own
// redrawn gates - and 52 composites built on them (`WALLAA08.FARMAA00` and the rest, a wall and a farm made one), at a
// higher priority, and online the room owns it. DFU's rule is one mod's file a name, so there the gates would carry no
// driver. Here the mod's appended records are a LAYER (formats/worldDataReplacement.js registerWorldDataLayer): laid
// onto whichever of those files the door serves, in the block's own coordinates, under the same header counts the
// editor leaves (DFU lays a block out by its arrays). Where the mod's own patch is what is served it already carries
// them, and the layer stands aside.
//
// NOT SEEN: how the carriages sit among Beautiful Cities' own gate furniture - this container has no ARENA2 to lay a
// town out in. The bible's page names it for the owner's eyes.
