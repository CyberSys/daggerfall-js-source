// HOME-LOOK (2026-09-30) — A HOUSE'S OUTSIDE, WORN AS ITS OWNER CHOSE.
//
// Asked: "The introduction of exterior customization. The ability to
// choose the texture for the roof, walls, door, windows, etc". The look
// is net/homeLaw.js homeLookOf's; this is how a face wears it.
//
// A FACE'S PART is read off the texture Daggerfall gave it (its original
// archive and record, before any climate swap): the roofs' family (69,
// and its winter 70), the doors' (74 - the frame's tapestry, record 3,
// never), a window (ClimateSwaps.IsExteriorWindow), or a building set's
// wall (the families IsExteriorWindow names, record 3 aside). Anything
// else - a fence, a sign, a castle's own special sets - is the town's.
//
// WHAT IT WEARS: the part's choice put through Daggerfall's own
// ApplyClimate from the family's desert index (the family itself), so the
// season's snow falls on it where Daggerfall's falls - a wall keeps its
// record (the set's own order, as a climate swap keeps it), a window is
// the set's record 3, and a roof or a door is the one record chosen.
//
// THE REMAP is the draw-time table the climate swap already is
// (world/texRemap.js: pixels from the swapped record, UVs the original's):
// a house painted is drawn with its OWN table - the pixel's climate swaps
// and its look's over them - and a record its archive lacks is left to
// the town's (the prune texRemap.js keeps, and for the same reason).
