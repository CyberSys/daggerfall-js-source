-- SEAT2b (2026-10-01, Mac: "Finish the seats"; "We need to do a comprehensive audit on everything and finish the not
-- done") - A SEAT'S FORTIFICATIONS (bible/11-Multiplayer/Seats-Arc.md 7.5): each work's standing tier, the SEAT's and not
-- its holder's, and the one tier a project is raising - begun by the holder's Guildmaster or an Officer (its Marks paid
-- from the treasury then), supplied from the seat's stockpile (town_seat_stockpile), standing 2, 4 or 7 days after its
-- last need was met (server-account/src/seatForts.js; src/net/fortLaw.js the law). A capture and a Season's end take
-- each a tier down; Season 0's end wipes them (seatTurning.js SEASON_ZERO_WIPED).

--   npx wrangler d1 migrations apply daggerfall-accounts --remote

-- Applied exactly once through the `d1_migrations` ledger, which the deploy runs (ACC1-CI).
