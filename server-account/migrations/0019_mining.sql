-- PROF2 (2026-09-28, Mac: "Go") - MINING AND QUARRYING, AND THE FORGE
-- (bible/06-Systems/Professions-Arc.md, PROF0 4.1, 4.5, 4.6, 6 and 23).
--
-- Two of PROF1's tables name what they hold in a CHECK, and SQLite changes
-- a CHECK only by building the table again: the day's harvests grow the
-- vein's `ore` and the boulder's `stone` beside the patch's two kinds, and
-- a gem a strike found; the witnessed world grows its second kind, the
-- dungeon (a dungeon vein's ground, SEAT0 3.2's law). Each is built new,
-- filled from the old, and takes the old one's name and index. Nothing
-- references either table, so the swap moves no foreign key.

-- THE DAY'S HARVESTS: as 0018 kept them, `kind` one of a patch's two
-- (herbs, food), a vein's (ore) or a boulder's (stone); `gem` the gem a
-- strike on the glint found beside the ore (one at most, PROF0 23).
