-- MARKS1 (2026-09-28) - MARKS, THE SERVER'S CURRENCY.
--
--   npx wrangler d1 migrations apply daggerfall-accounts --remote
--
-- Applied exactly once through the `d1_migrations` ledger, which the
-- deploy runs (ACC1-CI).
--
-- Mac: "New currency" (bible/06-Systems/Professions-Arc.md 10.5, PROF0).
-- A Mark is held here alone and struck only for an act a server
-- witnessed; the law both ends read is src/net/marksLaw.js.
--
-- ═══ THE LEDGER IS THE TRUTH, AND IT MOVES THE BALANCES ═══════════
--
-- One ledger for every movement (the record's), and the balances are its
-- running sums, moved by the triggers below ON THE LINE'S OWN INSERT. So
-- no Mark moves without a line, and no line is written for Marks that did
-- not move - GUILD1's law for its gold treasury (0013_guilds.sql), turned
-- the right way round for a currency: there the treasury's UPDATE writes
-- the line; here the line writes the balances, because a Mark moving from
-- an account to a guild is ONE line touching TWO balances, and one INSERT
-- is one statement.
--
-- ONE STATEMENT DECIDES (server-account/src/marks.js): every movement is
-- a single `INSERT ... SELECT ... WHERE` whose WHERE holds the payer's
-- balance, the payee's cap and the day's cap as they stand at that
-- statement - so two requests racing never overdraw a balance nor pass a
-- cap. The CHECKs below are the net under that floor, not the floor.
--
-- `src_kind` 'mint' is a faucet and `dst_kind` 'burn' a sink; every other
-- line moves Marks between an account and a guild. `day` is the UTC day
-- (at / 86400) the caps count by. `actor` and `rid` make a request asked
-- twice - its answer lost - one line: UNIQUE, and the service answers the
-- line it finds.
--
-- CASCADE: an account that is gone takes its balance with it ("An account
-- is deleted: its Marks go" - PROF0 18); its ledger lines stay, the
-- economy's audit ("the Marks ledger ... forever" - PROF0 20). A guild's
-- Marks treasury goes with its guild - which GUILD1's disband refuses
-- while the treasury holds anything (guilds.js).
