-- PROF6 (2026-09-29, Mac: "continue") - GUILD WRITS, THE GUILD STORES AND COMMISSIONS
-- (bible/06-Systems/Professions-Arc.md 7, 11, 14, 28).
--
--   npx wrangler d1 migrations apply daggerfall-accounts --remote
--
-- Applied exactly once through the `d1_migrations` ledger, which the deploy runs (ACC1-CI). Every act below is
-- decided by ONE statement that writes its row with a fresh nonce `n`; everything that follows is keyed on it
-- (server-account/src/writs.js), as PROF1-5's acts are. The Court's writs stay `writs` (0020) - they mint; these move
-- Marks a guild or a player holds, on the ledger's `escrow` end (0025), their ids the writ's or the commission's.

-- A GUILD'S WRITS (11): posted by its Guildmaster, or an Officer within the week's budget (`officer` 1, `week` the
-- seat week it was posted in - writLaw seatWeek); the whole pay escrowed from the guild's Marks treasury, drawn down by
-- each delivery; closed filled, withdrawn or expired, and what is left returned once (`returned`). The poster's account
-- may go (SET NULL) - the writ is the guild's. A guild with a writ standing does not disband (guilds.js), so the
-- cascade meets only closed rows.
