-- GUILD2 (2026-10-03) - THE GUILD PAGE'S OVERHAUL: A NEW NAME FOR A PRICE, THE VAULT AND WHO MAY USE IT
-- (bible/11-Multiplayer/Guild-Overhaul.md; the laws are src/net/guildLaw.js and src/net/guildVaultLaw.js).
--
--   npx wrangler d1 migrations apply daggerfall-accounts --remote
--
-- Applied exactly once through the `d1_migrations` ledger, which the deploy runs (ACC1-CI).

-- GUILD2a: WHEN A GUILD LAST TOOK A NEW NAME (epoch seconds, NULL for never) - the next may come a fortnight on
-- (guildLaw.js GUILD_RENAME_COOLDOWN_S); and every rename written down, the names it left and took and what it paid. The
-- treasury's own line is the ledger trigger's (0046's `moved_kind` 'rename').

-- is taken by its primary key, so two deposits racing for one write one and refuse the other whole.
