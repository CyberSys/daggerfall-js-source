// INCURSION'S MARKS (bible/11-Multiplayer/Seats-Arc.md 9.3: "gate kills in the kingdom's regions give double influence,
// and double Marks (PROF0 10.5)"). SEASON1 part two doubled the influence and left the Marks unpaid, because a kill's
// region is the claiming client's word until three claims agree - and a faucet is not doubled on one account's word.
// So the second half is paid at the Turning that settles the week, once the day's region IS agreed
// (seatInfluence.js agreedGateRegions): every account whose claim named the agreed region, in a land whose week rolled
// a Daedric Incursion, and whose gate Marks that day were struck (marks.js gateStrikeStatement's line), is minted the
// same again - once (its own `incursion:<day>` rid), and only where its balance has the room (a full purse is not
// paid; nothing is refused).
