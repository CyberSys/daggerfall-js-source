// SEAT1c (2026-09-30, Mac: "Finish the seats") - THE TURNING: the week
// settled, the Charters claimed, the Contested seats and the Rights of
// Siege named, the Legacy carried.
//
// bible/11-Multiplayer/Seats-Arc.md 5.2: "The Turning is never a job that
// runs. The account service settles week N the first time anything asks
// about any seat after N's boundary (settleWeek(N), one D1 transaction,
// idempotent on town_seat_weeks.week - a second reader finds it
// settled)." The decision is townSeatLaw.js turningPlan, pure; this file
// gathers what it reads and writes what it answers, in ONE batch whose
// first statement is the week's own key - a plain INSERT, so a second
// reader racing the first fails on the key and its whole batch rolls back.
// A batch that fails for any other reason (a treasury emptied between the
// read and the write) rolls back whole too, and the next read settles it
// again.
//
// The settle reads the week's standings as they stood at its Turning
// (seatInfluence.js gatherStandings - a home's days counted to the
// boundary, not to the reader's now). SEAT1d: each holder's week beside
// it - its own members' Watch there, the gates felled in its region, its
// writs filled there, its Tithe and what it owes from Neglect, the Edict
// proclaimed for the coming week - and the accounts that played (the
// crown's scale); the batch pays the upkeep and the Edicts, lapses a
// Charter neglected twice, writes every Standing, and sends a Bounty's
// unspent escrow home. SEAT2a: the battles a Right or a Contested seat names placed in
// the coming week (step 8) - their fighting is the relay's. CROWN1: a crown's Conscription
// that ruled the week paid out of the conscripted guilds' Tithe (7.6), after their upkeep;
// and part two: a Royal Tourney's prize escrowed as it is made law, and the week's champion
// named, paid and titled as its week settles. CROWN2: each vassal's tribute to its liege (5% of
// its week's Tithe, after its upkeep), the liege's half-reach on a vassal's defence, a fealty
// broken (the breaker's Standing -10 at every seat) or lapsed (a pair that no longer fits).
//
// EVERY CLOCK IS AN ARGUMENT, as in accounts.js.
