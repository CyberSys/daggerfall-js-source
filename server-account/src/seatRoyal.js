// CROWN1 part two (2026-10-01, Mac: "Finish the seats"; "Continue";
// "Hurry up") - THE ROYAL TOURNEY, AS THE SERVICE KEEPS IT: who may enter
// (the pass, over the ring the contenders' games agree), the bouts the
// winners' receipts bring (counted by the room's own ladder rule), the
// ladder on the Seat tab, and the week's champion named at the Turning -
// the prize the Edict escrowed paid to its account, the title kept for
// good.
//
// bible/11-Multiplayer/Seats-Arc.md 7.6. The bouts are the relay's
// (net/siegeRef.js royal*); a winner's `t1` receipt is its word that one
// was won (net/siegeReceipt.js). FACT, as for a siege: the relay has no
// door to this service, so each receipt rides its winner's own client.
//
// ONE STATEMENT DECIDES: a bout's row is keyed on its room's number, so a
// receipt carried twice counts once, and whether it counts (the same two
// at most ROYAL_PAIR_DAY a UTC day - their rows that day, which past the
// third are the uncounted alone) is asked inside its own INSERT.
//
// EVERY CLOCK IS AN ARGUMENT, as in accounts.js.
